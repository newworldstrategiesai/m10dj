# Meta Description Uniqueness Issue - Fix Required

## 🚨 Problem Identified

In Google search results, multiple pages show **identical or very similar descriptions** even though the titles are different. This is **NOT good for SEO** because:

1. **Poor User Experience:** Users can't distinguish between pages
2. **Duplicate Content Signals:** Google may see this as duplicate content
3. **Missed Opportunities:** Each page should have unique, compelling descriptions
4. **Lower Click-Through Rates:** Generic descriptions don't entice clicks
