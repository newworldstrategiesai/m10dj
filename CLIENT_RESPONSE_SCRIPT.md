# Response Script for Current Situation

## The Situation
- ✅ Already agreed to remove monogram projection ($250)
- ❌ Client now wants to remove extra hour ($300)
- Need to: Set boundary without looking inconsistent

---

## Recommended Response

### Option 1: Firm but Friendly Boundary (Recommended)

**Message:**
> "Perfect! I've removed the monogram projection from Package 2, so your total is now $2,250.
> 
> Regarding the extra hour - I'd really recommend keeping it. Here's why: The extra hour ensures seamless transitions between your ceremony, cocktail hour, and reception. Most couples find they need this buffer time for photos, guest arrival, or unexpected delays. Without it, you risk rushing between events or potentially paying overtime fees ($150/hour) if things run long.
> 
> Our packages are designed as complete solutions, and the bundle discount applies when you take the package as-is. If we remove too many items, we'd need to price it closer to a la carte rates, which would actually cost more.
> 
> Package 2 at $2,250 (without monogram) is still a great value - you're saving $1,150 compared to a la carte pricing. Would you like to proceed with Package 2 at $2,250?"

**Why this works:**
- ✅ Honors what was already promised
- ✅ Sets clear boundary going forward
- ✅ Explains value of keeping the hour
- ✅ Maintains relationship
- ✅ Doesn't look inconsistent (explains why this is different)

### Option 2: Frame as Risk (Softer Approach)

**Message:**
> "Great! I've removed the monogram projection, so your Package 2 is now $2,250.
> 
> About the extra hour - I can remove it, but I want to make sure you're aware of the risks:
> 
> **What you'd lose:**
> - Buffer time between ceremony and reception
> - Flexibility if photos run long
> - Protection against overtime fees ($150/hour if event runs over)
> - Peace of mind knowing you have time built in
> 
> **Most couples find the $300 for the extra hour is worth it for peace of mind**, especially on such an important day. But if your timeline is very tight and you're confident everything will run on schedule, I can remove it. The package would be $1,950.
> 
> What do you think? Would you like to keep the extra hour for peace of mind, or remove it?"

**Why this works:**
- ✅ Still allows removal but makes it feel risky
- ✅ Client acknowledges the risk
- ✅ Many will reconsider
- ✅ If they still want it removed, they've been warned

### Option 3: Offer Alternative Package (Redirect)

**Message:**
> "Perfect! I've removed the monogram projection from Package 2, so your total is now $2,250.
> 
> I understand you're trying to optimize the package. Since you're thinking about removing the extra hour too, let me suggest an alternative:
> 
> **Package 1 might be a better fit** - it's $2,000 and includes:
> - 4 hours of DJ/MC services at reception
> - Dance floor lighting
> - Uplighting
> - Additional speaker
> 
> You could add ceremony audio separately if needed ($500), bringing the total to $2,500 - same as Package 2, but you'd have more control over what's included.
> 
> Or, we can stick with Package 2 at $2,250 (without monogram) - it's still our most popular choice and saves you $1,150 compared to a la carte. The extra hour is really valuable for peace of mind on your wedding day.
> 
> What do you think would work best for you?"

**Why this works:**
- ✅ Redirects to a different package
- ✅ Gives client a choice
- ✅ Maintains package integrity
- ✅ Doesn't feel like a "no"

## My Recommendation: Use Option 1

**Why:**
- Sets a clear boundary without being harsh
- Explains why this is different from monogram removal
- Maintains the relationship
- Prevents further requests
- Professional and friendly

**Key phrases:**
- "I'd really recommend keeping it" (friendly but firm)
- "Our packages are designed as complete solutions" (explains policy)
- "Bundle discount applies when you take the package as-is" (sets boundary)
- "Would you like to proceed?" (assumes the sale)

---

## What NOT to Say

❌ "I already removed the monogram, I can't remove anything else"
   - Sounds arbitrary and inconsistent

❌ "No, you can't remove the extra hour"
   - Too harsh, damages relationship

❌ "If I remove that, the package won't make sense"
   - Sounds like you're making excuses

✅ Instead: Explain the value and set boundary with reasoning

---

## If Client Pushes Back

**If they say:** "But you removed the monogram, why not the extra hour?"

**Response:**
> "I understand the confusion. The monogram was a visual add-on that some couples don't need. The extra hour is actually core to the package - it ensures your entire wedding day flows smoothly. Without it, you risk rushing between events or paying overtime fees.
> 
> Our packages work best when taken as complete solutions. If we remove too many core items, we'd need to price it at a la carte rates, which would actually cost more than the package.
> 
> Package 2 at $2,250 (without monogram) is still an excellent value - you're saving $1,150. Would you like to proceed with that?"

**Key points:**
- Acknowledge their concern
- Explain the difference (add-on vs. core service)
- Reinforce value
- Assume the sale

---

## Expected Outcome

**Best case:**
- Client accepts Package 2 at $2,250
- No further removal requests
- Relationship maintained
- Sale closed

**Worst case:**
- Client insists on removing extra hour
- You can either:
  - Hold firm (recommended) - "I understand, but our packages work best as complete solutions. Would you like to consider Package 1 instead?"
  - Or remove it but explain it's the last change - "I can remove it, but this would be the final adjustment. The package would be $1,950."

**Either way:**
- You've set a boundary
- Client understands the policy
- Future clients won't have this issue (if you implement policy)

---

## Long-Term: Prevent This Going Forward

1. **Set policy:** Packages are fixed-price bundles (except for specific add-ons like monogram)
2. **Update messaging:** "Packages are designed as complete solutions"
3. **Create Package 1.5:** Fill the gap between Package 1 and Package 2
4. **Train team:** Use consistent messaging about package policy

---

## Summary

**For this client right now:**
- Use Option 1 (Firm but Friendly Boundary)
- Honor the monogram removal
- Set boundary on extra hour
- Explain value and policy
- Assume the sale

**Going forward:**
- Set clear policy on what can/can't be removed
- Update messaging to reflect fixed-price packages
- Create alternative packages to fill gaps

The key is to be consistent, friendly, and value-focused - not arbitrary or harsh.
