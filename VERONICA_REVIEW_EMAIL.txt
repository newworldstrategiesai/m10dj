Subject: Thank you, Veronica!

Hi Veronica,

I hope you're doing well! I wanted to reach out and say thank you again for having M10 DJ Company at your event on December 6th. I'm really glad it went well and that you had a great time!

If you have a quick minute, I'd love it if you could leave us a review on Google. Reviews from happy clients like you really help us help other people in Memphis find quality DJ services for their events. Here's the direct link:

It only takes about 60 seconds, and your feedback means a lot to us. Plus, it helps future clients know what to expect when they book with us!

Thanks again for everything, and I hope we can work together again in the future.

Best regards,
Ben Murray
