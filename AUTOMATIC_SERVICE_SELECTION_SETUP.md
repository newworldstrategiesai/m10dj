The system sends service selection links ONLY when:
- ‚úÖ Event type is "wedding" or "Wedding"
- ‚úÖ Contact form submission is successful
- ‚úÖ Contact record is created in database
- ‚úÖ Resend API key is configured

### **Event Types That Trigger:**
- "wedding"

- Birthday parties
- School events
- Other event types

This ensures you only send service selection to wedding leads (where packages apply).

## üìä What Gets Saved

When a service selection link is generated, the system saves:

**In `contacts.custom_fields`:**
```json
{
  "service_selection_token": "base64_encoded_token",
  "service_selection_link": "https://www.m10djcompany.com/select-services/TOKEN",
  "token_generated_at": "2025-01-28T10:30:00Z",
  "link_sent_at": "2025-01-28T10:30:00Z"
}
```

**Contact Status Updated:**
- `lead_status` ‚Üí Changed to "Service Selection Sent"

**When Lead Submits Selections:**
- Package choice saved
- Add-ons saved
- Total price saved
- Additional notes saved
- Status updated to "Proposal Sent"

---

## üîê Security Features

### **Token Security:**
- SHA-256 hash prevents tampering
- Includes contact ID, email, and timestamp
- Uses your NEXTAUTH_SECRET environment variable
- Base64URL encoded for safety in URLs
- Cannot be guessed or forged

### **Link Expiration:**
- Currently no expiration (links work indefinitely)
- Can be enhanced to add expiration if desired

### **Access Control:**
- Links are private (not indexed by search engines)
- Each link is unique to one contact
- No authentication required for lead to access
- Only works for the specific contact it was generated for

---

## üìù Logging & Debugging

The system provides detailed console logging:

### **When a Lead Submits:**
```
üéØ Detected wedding inquiry - preparing to send service selection link...
‚úÖ Service selection link sent to john@example.com
   Link: https://www.m10djcompany.com/select-services/ABC123
   ‚úÖ Email delivered successfully
```

### **For Non-Wedding Events:**

```

## üõ†Ô∏è Customization Options

if (standardizedEventType === 'wedding' || standardizedEventType === 'Wedding') {

// To include corporate events:
if (standardizedEventType === 'wedding' || standardizedEventType === 'Wedding' || standardizedEventType === 'corporate') {

// To send to ALL event types:
if (true) {  // Always send
```

### **Customize Email Template:**

Edit `/utils/service-selection-helper.js`, the `sendServiceSelectionEmail` function:
- Change colors (search for `#fcba00` - your gold color)
- Modify wording
- Add/remove sections
- Change CTA button text

### **Add Link Expiration:**

In `/utils/service-selection-helper.js`, add to `generateServiceSelectionToken`:
```javascript
const tokenData = {
  contactId: contact.id,
  email: contact.email_address,
  timestamp: Date.now(),
  expiresAt: Date.now() + (7 * 24 * 60 * 60 * 1000), // 7 days
  hash: crypto.createHash('sha256')...
};
```

Then in `/pages/select-services/[token].tsx`, validate expiration.

## üìà Tracking & Analytics

### **Monitor Success Rate:**

```sql
-- How many service selection links were sent?
SELECT COUNT(*) as links_sent
FROM contacts
WHERE custom_fields->>'service_selection_link' IS NOT NULL;

-- How many leads clicked and submitted?
SELECT COUNT(*) as selections_submitted
FROM contacts
WHERE custom_fields->'service_selection' IS NOT NULL;

-- Conversion rate:
SELECT 
  COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE custom_fields->>'service_selection_link' IS NOT NULL) as links_sent,
  COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE custom_fields->'service_selection' IS NOT NULL) as selections_submitted,
  ROUND(
    100.0 * COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE custom_fields->'service_selection' IS NOT NULL) / 
    NULLIF(COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE custom_fields->>'service_selection_link' IS NOT NULL), 0)
  , 2) as conversion_rate_percent
FROM contacts
WHERE event_type = 'wedding';
```

---

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### **Email Not Sending:**

**Check:**
1. Is `RESEND_API_KEY` set in your environment variables?
2. Check server logs for error messages
3. Verify email address is valid
4. Check Resend dashboard for delivery status

**Fix:**
```bash
# Verify environment variable
echo $RESEND_API_KEY

# Should output your API key
# If empty, add to .env.local:
RESEND_API_KEY=re_xxxxxxxxxxxxx
```

### **Service Selection Page Not Loading:**

**Check:**
1. Token is being generated correctly (check logs)
2. Token is saved to contact's `custom_fields`
3. Link is properly formatted
4. Page `/select-services/[token].tsx` exists

**Debug:**
```javascript
// In browser console on selection page:
console.log(window.location.pathname);
// Should show: /select-services/TOKEN

// Check if token is valid by trying to decode:
const token = 'PASTE_TOKEN_HERE';
try {
  const decoded = JSON.parse(atob(token.replace(/_/g, '/').replace(/-/g, '+')));
  console.log('Decoded token:', decoded);
} catch(e) {
  console.error('Invalid token:', e);
}
```

### **Contact Not Found:**

**Check:**
1. Contact was created successfully
2. Email address matches
3. Contact wasn't deleted (`deleted_at IS NULL`)
4. Database permissions are correct
