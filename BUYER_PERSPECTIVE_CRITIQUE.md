# Buyer Perspective: Pricing Structure Critique

## 🚨 CRITICAL CONFUSION ISSUES

### Problem 1: Package 2 Description Contradicts Features

**Package 2 says:**
- Description: "Reception Only - Most Popular"
- But features include: "Ceremony + cocktail hour + reception"

**Buyer thinks:**
- "Wait, it says 'Reception Only' but includes ceremony? That doesn't make sense."
- "Is this a mistake? Should I trust this?"
- "What does 'Reception Only' even mean if it includes ceremony?"

### Problem 2: Inconsistent Naming

**Package 1:** "Reception Only" ✅ (Actually is reception only)
**Package 2:** "Reception Only" ❌ (But includes ceremony!)
**Package 3:** "Ceremony & Reception" ✅ (Includes ceremony)

**Buyer thinks:**
- "Why are Package 1 and 2 both called 'Reception Only' but Package 2 has ceremony?"
- "What's the actual difference between Package 2 and Package 3 if they both have ceremony?"

### Problem 3: Unclear Value Differentiation

**Package 2 vs Package 3:**
- Both have: Ceremony + Cocktail Hour + Reception (6 hours)
- Both have: Same lighting, uplighting, speakers
- Difference: Package 3 has "Dancing on the Clouds" ($500 value)
- Price difference: $500

**Buyer thinks:**
- "So I'm paying $500 more just for one special effect?"
- "Is that worth it? What else is different?"
- "Why is Package 2 'Most Popular' if Package 3 is only $500 more?"
