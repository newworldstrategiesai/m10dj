## 🚀 FINAL STEPS TO GET INVOICES WORKING

### Step 1: Run the Invoice Migration

Go to your Supabase SQL Editor and run:
```
supabase/migrations/20250127000002_create_invoices_table_fixed.sql
```

This creates:
- `invoices` table
- `invoice_line_items` table
- `invoice_summary` view (powers the dashboard)
- `overdue_invoices` view
- `monthly_invoice_stats` view
- Automatic functions and triggers

### Step 2: Generate Invoices from Payments

After the migration runs successfully, run this script:

```bash
cd /Users/benmurray/m10dj
export $(cat .env.local | grep -v '^#' | xargs)
node scripts/generate-invoices-from-payments.js
```

This will create ~39 invoices with detailed line items from your HoneyBook payment data!

### Step 3: Access Your Dashboards

Once invoices are generated:

1. **Projects Dashboard**: `/admin/projects`
   - View all 39 generated projects
   - Filter by status, date, client
   - See project details, financials, timeline

2. **Invoices Dashboard**: `/admin/invoices`
   - View all invoices with filtering
   - See payment status, overdue alerts
   - Track outstanding balances
   - Click any invoice to view full details

3. **Contacts Dashboard**: `/admin/contacts/[id]`
   - Now shows linked projects
   - Shows payment history
   - Shows invoices (once invoice UI is integrated)

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

If invoices don't appear after running the script:

1. Check the SQL migration ran without errors
2. Verify the `invoice_summary` view exists:
   ```sql
   SELECT * FROM invoice_summary LIMIT 5;
   ```
3. Check if invoices were created:
   ```sql
   SELECT COUNT(*) FROM invoices;
   ```
4. Re-run the invoice generation script with error logging

## 🎉 That's It!

Once you run the migration and generation script, you'll have:
- 39 Projects viewable at `/admin/projects`
