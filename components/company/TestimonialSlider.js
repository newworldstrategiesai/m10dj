We had younger kids, grandparents and all the others in between- the music was appropriate and also right up our alley. Ben went over the top to make sure the night went amazingly.

He was extremely professional with his communication and knew the right questions to ask us about specific music for planned dances and also about what kind of music we thought our attendees would like. I've never been to a wedding where the DJ mixes his own tracks throughout the open dance time, but Ben made that work extremely well! He read the room and knew when to switch to keep the energy up on the dancefloor.",
