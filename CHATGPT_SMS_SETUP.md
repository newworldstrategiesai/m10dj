## 💬 Sample Conversations

### **New Customer - Wedding Inquiry:**

**Customer**: "Hi, I need a DJ for my wedding next summer"

**AI**: "Congratulations on your upcoming wedding! 🎵 I'd love to help make it unforgettable. What date are you planning for next summer?"

**Customer**: "June 15th, 2025 at The Peabody Hotel"

**AI**: "Perfect! The Peabody is such a beautiful venue. For a wedding on June 15th, our packages typically range $1,200-$2,500 depending on hours and equipment needs. How many guests are you expecting?"

### **Existing Customer Follow-up:**

**Customer**: "Hey, just checking on my quote"

**AI**: "Hi Sarah! Great to hear from you again about your October 12th wedding at Dixon Gallery! 🎉 Ben is finalizing your custom quote for the 6-hour package with uplighting. He'll have that to you by tomorrow morning. Any other questions about the setup?"
