-- Setup Supabase Storage for Organization Assets
-- 
-- IMPORTANT: This migration is intentionally empty.
-- Storage policies cannot be created via migrations due to permission requirements.
-- 
-- See WHITE_LABEL_SETUP.md for complete setup instructions.
-- Storage policies must be created manually via Supabase Dashboard.
--
-- Quick Setup:
-- 1. Create bucket "organization-assets" (Public: Yes, 5MB limit, image/* MIME types)
-- 2. Go to Storage → organization-assets → Policies → Create policies manually
-- 3. Or use the Supabase Dashboard UI to create policies (recommended)
--
-- For SQL-based setup, see: supabase/migrations/20250125000003_storage_policies_manual.sql
-- (Run that file in Supabase SQL Editor, not as a migration)
