## üíæ **WHAT GETS SAVED**

When a lead submits their selections:

### **Stored in `contacts.custom_fields`:**
```json
{
  "service_selection": {
    "package": {
      "id": "package-2",
      "name": "Package 2",
      "basePrice": 2500
    },
    "addOns": [
      {
        "id": "dancing-clouds",
        "name": "Dancing on the Clouds",
        "price": 500,
        "quantity": 1
      }
    ],
    "total": 3000,
    "additionalNotes": "We want purple uplighting to match our theme",
    "submittedAt": "2025-01-27T10:30:00Z"
  }
}
```

### **Updated in `contacts` table:**
- `lead_status` ‚Üí Changed to "Proposal Sent"
- `notes` ‚Üí Appended with summary of selections
- `updated_at` ‚Üí Timestamp updated

---

## üîê **SECURITY**

### **How Tokens Work:**
1. Token is generated from contact ID + email + secret + timestamp
2. Base64URL encoded (URL-safe)
3. Stored in contact's `custom_fields` for verification
4. Can't be guessed or tampered with (includes hash)

### **Access Control:**
- ‚úÖ Only admin users can generate links
- ‚úÖ Links are unique per contact
- ‚úÖ Page is `noindex, nofollow` (not searchable)
- ‚úÖ Invalid tokens redirect to homepage
- ‚úÖ One-time use (after submission, shows thank you page)

### **Production Improvements:**
For enhanced security in production, consider:
- JWT tokens with expiration
- Database table for tokens with expiry timestamps
- Rate limiting on link generation
- Email verification before showing selections

---

## üé® **CUSTOMIZATION**

### **Change Package Prices:**

Edit `pages/select-services/[token].tsx`:

```tsx
const packages: Package[] = [
  {
    id: 'package-1',
    name: 'Package 1',
    description: 'Reception Only',
    basePrice: 2000, // Change this
    // ...
  },
  // ...
];
```

### **Add/Remove Add-Ons:**

```tsx
const addOns: AddOn[] = [
  {
    id: 'new-addon',
    name: 'New Service',
    description: 'Description here',
    price: 400,
    category: 'effects'
  },
  // ...
];
```

### **Change Colors/Branding:**

The page uses Tailwind classes:
- `from-purple-600 to-pink-600` - Gradient for selected package
- `bg-brand` - Your brand color
- `text-brand-gold` - Gold accent for "Most Popular"
