Hey Megan! 

I'm doing great, thanks! So cool we reconnected! 

I've got you set up with a personalized page where you can see all my packages and pricing. It's super quick - just takes 2-3 minutes and you can select everything you need right there. Here's your link:

You can compare the packages, add on things like uplighting or monogram projection if you want, and see the total price in real-time. No pressure at all - just browse and let me know what you think!

Feel free to call or text me anytime if you have questions - (901) 410-2020. Excited to help make your wedding amazing! 🎉
