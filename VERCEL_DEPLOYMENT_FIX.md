# üöÄ Vercel Deployment Troubleshooting Guide

## Quick Fix Checklist

### 1. **Check Vercel Dashboard**
- Go to: https://vercel.com/dashboard
- Find your **m10dj** project
- Check the **Deployments** tab:
  - Do you see any failed deployments?
  - Are there any build errors?
  - Is the latest commit showing up?

### 2. **Verify Git Integration**
- Go to: **Settings** ‚Üí **Git**
- Confirm GitHub repo is connected: `newworldstrategiesai/m10dj`
- Make sure the correct branch is selected: `main`

### 3. **Check Build Logs**
- Click on the latest deployment (even if failed)
- Scroll down to **Build Logs**
- Look for error messages, especially:
  - Puppeteer installation errors
  - Missing environment variables
  - Build timeout errors

### 4. **Common Issues & Fixes**

#### Issue: Puppeteer Build Failures
**Problem**: Puppeteer is large and can cause Vercel build timeouts

**Solution**: We've added `vercel.json` with:
- Increased function timeout (30s)
- Increased memory (3008MB)
- Proper Puppeteer configuration

**Next Step**: Push the `vercel.json` file we just created:
```bash
git add vercel.json
git commit -m "Add Vercel config for Puppeteer PDF generation"
git push origin main
```

#### Issue: Missing Environment Variables
**Check Vercel Settings** ‚Üí **Environment Variables**:
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL`
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`
- `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY`
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL` (should be `https://m10djcompany.com`)
- Any other API keys your app needs

#### Issue: Git Author Not Recognized
**Problem**: Vercel might not recognize your git commits

**Fix**:
1. Go to Vercel **Settings** ‚Üí **Git**
2. Make sure your GitHub account is connected
3. Check that you're a member of the Vercel team/project

### 5. **Manual Deployment Trigger**
If automatic deployments aren't working:
1. Go to Vercel Dashboard
2. Click on your project
3. Click **Deployments** tab
4. Click **"..."** on latest deployment
5. Click **"Redeploy"**

### 6. **Check GitHub Webhooks**
1. Go to: https://github.com/newworldstrategiesai/m10dj/settings/hooks
2. Look for Vercel webhook
3. If missing or failing, reconnect in Vercel Settings ‚Üí Git

### 7. **Puppeteer Alternative (If Still Failing)**
If Puppeteer continues causing issues, we can switch to `@sparticuz/chromium` which is optimized for serverless environments.

## üîç Debug Steps

1. **Check Recent Commits**:
   ```bash
   git log --oneline -5
   ```

2. **Verify Push**:
   ```bash
   git remote -v
   git branch
   ```

3. **Check Vercel Activity**:
   - Go to Vercel Dashboard ‚Üí Your Project ‚Üí Deployments
   - Look for latest activity timestamp

4. **Review Build Output**:
   - Open any failed deployment
   - Scroll through build logs
   - Look for red error messages

## üìù Next Steps

After pushing `vercel.json`:
1. Check Vercel dashboard within 1-2 minutes
2. Should see new deployment starting
3. Monitor build progress
4. If it fails, check logs and share errors
