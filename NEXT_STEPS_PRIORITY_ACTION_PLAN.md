## 🚀 **IMMEDIATE NEXT PRIORITIES**

### **Priority 1: Fix Indexing Issues (CRITICAL)**

**Actions:**
1. **Audit Google Search Console Coverage Report**
   - Check "Discovered - Currently Not Indexed"
   - Check "Crawled - Currently Not Indexed"
   - Document which pages are excluded and why

2. **Fix Thin Content Pages**
   - Expand location pages (`dj-germantown-tn.js`, `dj-collierville-tn.js`, etc.) to 500+ words
   - Add unique, helpful content to each location page
   - Add Memphis-specific details and real examples

3. **Request Manual Indexing**
   - After fixing pages, request indexing in Search Console
   - Focus on top 10 priority pages first

**Expected Impact:** Pages will start ranking once indexed

**Pages to Enhance:**
- `/dj-germantown-tn` 
- `/dj-collierville-tn`
