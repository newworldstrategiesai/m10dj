# 🚀 Vercel Deployment Check Guide

## Current Status

**Latest Commit**: `8d7d6bf` - "feat: Add comprehensive mobile UI improvements"

## ✅ Quick Deployment Check

### 1. **Check Vercel Dashboard**
Go to: https://vercel.com/dashboard
- Find your **m10dj** project
- Check **Deployments** tab
- Look for latest deployment matching commit `8d7d6bf`

### 2. **Verify Deployment Status**
In Vercel Dashboard → Deployments:
- ✅ **Ready** = Deployment successful
- ⏳ **Building** = Currently deploying
- ❌ **Error** = Build failed (check logs)

### 3. **If Deployment Not Showing**
Possible issues:
- Git webhook not connected
- Vercel doesn't have access to GitHub repo
- Deployment is paused

## 🔧 Quick Fixes

### **Trigger Manual Deployment**
1. Go to Vercel Dashboard → Your Project
2. Click **Deployments** tab
3. Click **"..."** on latest deployment
4. Click **"Redeploy"**

### **Check Git Integration**
1. Vercel Dashboard → **Settings** → **Git**
2. Verify: `newworldstrategiesai/m10dj` is connected
3. Verify branch: `main`

### **Verify Latest Commit is Deployed**
Check if deployment commit hash matches:
```bash
git log -1 --format="%H"
```

Then check Vercel deployment logs for that commit hash.
