## 💡 Why Package 2 is "Most Popular"

Even though Package 1 has better savings (23% vs 12%), Package 2 is most popular because:

1. **Most couples need ceremony audio** - Package 1 doesn't include it
2. **Better value for ceremony + reception** - If you need ceremony, Package 2 is the better deal
3. **Complete package** - Everything most couples need in one package
4. **No add-ons needed** - Package 1 would require adding ceremony audio separately ($500)

**The Math:**
- Package 1 ($2,000) + Ceremony Audio ($500) = $2,500
- Package 2 = $2,500 (same price, but includes everything bundled)

So Package 2 is the same price as Package 1 + ceremony audio, but you get it as a complete package with the savings built in.
