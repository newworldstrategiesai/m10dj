# Package 2 Pricing Analysis: Removing Monogram

## Current Package 2 Breakdown

### A La Carte Value:
- 4 Hours DJ/MC Services: $1,600
- Ceremony Audio: $500
- Dance Floor Lighting: $400
- Uplighting (16 fixtures): $350
- **Total A La Carte: $2,850**

### Current Package 2 Price: $2,500
- **Savings: $350** (this was the monogram value)

## Pricing Options When Removing Monogram

### Option 1: Keep at $2,500 (RECOMMENDED)
**Rationale:**
- Package still provides $350 in savings on the remaining items
- Ceremony audio ($500) + Uplighting ($350) = $850 value add
- Maintains profit margin
- Better value perception (they're still getting a deal)
- Simpler - no price adjustment needed

**Client Perspective:**
- "You're still getting $350 off the a la carte price"
- "The package includes ceremony audio and uplighting which are high-value items"

### Option 2: Reduce to $2,150
**Rationale:**
- Removes the $350 monogram value entirely
- More "fair" from client's perspective
- They're not paying for something they don't want

**Client Perspective:**
- "You're only paying for what you get"
- More transparent pricing

## Recommendation: **Keep at $2,500**

### Why?
1. **Value Still Exists**: Ceremony audio + uplighting alone are $850 in value
2. **Package Discount**: They're still getting $350 off a la carte pricing
3. **Simpler Sales**: No price negotiation needed
4. **Maintains Margin**: Keeps your profit structure intact
5. **Industry Standard**: Most DJ packages don't reduce price when removing optional items - they just remove the item

## What to Tell Marlee

**Suggested Response:**
> "Absolutely! We can remove the monogram projection from Package 2. The package will still be $2,500 and includes everything else - the 4 hours of DJ/MC services, ceremony audio, dance floor lighting, and uplighting. You're still getting great value with the ceremony audio and uplighting included, which would be $850 if purchased separately."

**Alternative (if she pushes for discount):**
> "The package price stays at $2,500 because you're still getting significant value - the ceremony audio and uplighting alone are $850 if purchased separately, and the package gives you $350 in savings off the a la carte price. The monogram was just one component, but the real value is in the ceremony audio and uplighting."

## Psychology Note

- Clients who ask to remove items often expect a discount
- But in DJ/event services, packages are typically "all or nothing" on pricing
- The value is in the bundle, not individual components
- You can frame it as: "The package price reflects the value of the core services (DJ, ceremony audio, uplighting), and the monogram was just a bonus add-on"

## If You Must Discount

If she's a high-value client or you want to be flexible:
- **Minimum discount**: $200 (keeps $150 margin on the monogram)
- **Fair discount**: $250 (splits the difference)
- **Full discount**: $350 (removes monogram value entirely, reduces to $2,150)

But I'd recommend starting with $2,500 and only discounting if she pushes back.
