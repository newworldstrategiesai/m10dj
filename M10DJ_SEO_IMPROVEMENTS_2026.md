# M10 DJ Company – SEO Improvement Plan (Feb 2026)

**Data source:** [Google Search Console export](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/18EyXmLKP-LuFsG_9_ID1uip_RAGvH1bcHf-CrVj2mWo/edit?usp=sharing)  
**Date range in sheet:** 2025-11-08 → 2026-02-07  
**Product:** M10 DJ Company (m10djcompany.com) only.

## 1. What the GSC data shows

| Metric | Observation |
|--------|-------------|
| **Impressions** | Growing: ~100–120/day (Nov) → ~170–270/day (Jan–Feb). Good trend. |
| **Position** | Avg ~28–44; best days ~22–30. Still page 2–4, not page 1. |
| **CTR** | Often **0%**; spikes 0.5–3.77%. Overall very low. |
| **Clicks** | 0–4 per day; many days 0. |

**Main problems:**  
1. **CTR** – Titles/descriptions aren’t winning clicks.  
2. **Position** – Need to keep improving relevance and authority to reach page 1.  
3. **Zero-click days** – Even when you get impressions, you’re not converting them to visits.

## 1.1 Top goal: Rank #1 for “Memphis Wedding DJ” (no cannibalization)

**Primary target query:** exact phrase **“Memphis Wedding DJ”**.

**Single authority page:**  
**`/memphis-wedding-dj`** is the only page that should “own” this phrase in the eyes of Google. It already:
- Uses **“Memphis Wedding DJ”** at the start of the title and as the H1.
- Has the deepest content, FAQs, and schema for wedding DJ in Memphis.

**Cannibalization check – who else could rank for “Memphis Wedding DJ”?**

| Page | Current title / focus | Risk | Action |
|------|------------------------|------|--------|
| **/memphis-wedding-dj** | “Memphis Wedding DJ ★★★★★ 500+ Weddings \| M10 DJ” | None – this is the pillar. | Keep as-is; keep title starting with “Memphis Wedding DJ”. |
| **/ (homepage)** | “Best Wedding DJs in Memphis TN \| …” | Low – different phrase. | Do **not** add “Memphis Wedding DJ” to homepage title. |
| **/wedding-dj-memphis-tn** | “Wedding DJ Memphis TN ★★★★★ \| …” | Medium – close variant (“Wedding DJ Memphis TN”). | Keep title as “Wedding DJ Memphis TN”; do not lead with “Memphis Wedding DJ”. Add clear link to /memphis-wedding-dj with anchor “Memphis Wedding DJ” in first 100 words. |
| **/best-wedding-dj-memphis** | “Best Wedding DJ Memphis \| …” | Low – “Best Wedding DJ Memphis” is distinct. | OG title was “Memphis Wedding DJ Reviews” → change to “Best Wedding DJ Memphis \| …” so only the pillar uses “Memphis Wedding DJ” in titles. |
| **/memphis-wedding-dj-prices-2025** | Pricing page | Low – intent is cost/pricing. | Keep title pricing-focused; OK to say “Memphis Wedding DJ Prices” as secondary. |
| **/about** | “About M10 DJ Company \| **Memphis Wedding DJ**” | **Yes** – same phrase in title. | Change to “About M10 DJ Company \| Memphis DJ & Event Entertainment”. |
| **/contact** | “Contact M10 DJ Company \| **Memphis Wedding DJ**” | **Yes** – same phrase in title. | Change to “Contact M10 DJ Company \| Memphis DJ Services”. |
| Blog posts | e.g. “Memphis Wedding DJ Cost Guide” | Low – long-tail, different intent. | Keep; ensure each blog links to /memphis-wedding-dj as the main wedding DJ page. |

**Rules going forward**
1. **Only `/memphis-wedding-dj`** should have “Memphis Wedding DJ” as the **leading** title/H1 phrase.
2. All other wedding-related pages should use **distinct** phrases: “Best Wedding DJ Memphis,” “Wedding DJ Memphis TN,” “Memphis Wedding DJ Prices,” etc., and link to `/memphis-wedding-dj` with anchor “Memphis Wedding DJ” where it makes sense.
3. Supporting pages (About, Contact, Services) should not use “Memphis Wedding DJ” in the **title** tag; use “Memphis DJ” or “Memphis DJ & Event Entertainment” instead.
4. Do **not** create new pages targeting “Memphis Wedding DJ”; consolidate content and links on the single pillar.

### 1.2 Protected rankings – do not change winning meta

These queries are **already #1**; avoid changing title or description on the pages below so rankings are not hurt.

| Query | Page | What to preserve |
|-------|------|-------------------|
| **Corporate DJ Memphis** | `/corporate-events` | Keep title starting with “Corporate DJ Memphis \| Professional Corporate Event DJ Services” and description leading with “Corporate DJ Memphis - Professional corporate event DJ services…”. Do not rewrite for other keywords at the expense of this phrase. |
| **DJ Rentals Memphis** | `/dj-rentals-memphis` | Keep title “DJ Rentals Memphis from $75/Day \| Speakers, Mics, Lighting \| M10” and description “Memphis DJ equipment rental from $75/day. Pro speakers, wireless mics…” – the current winning meta. Do not rewrite for “rent dj equipment for wedding” etc. at the expense of “DJ Rentals Memphis.” |

When adding new keywords to these pages, do it in **body content, FAQs, or secondary meta** (e.g. keywords array), not by replacing the winning title/description.

### 1.3 Why we’re #1 for “Corporate DJ Memphis” & “DJ Rentals Memphis” but not “Memphis Wedding DJ”

**Short answer:** Competition and search demand. “Memphis Wedding DJ” is the single most valuable local phrase every wedding DJ in Memphis targets; “Corporate DJ Memphis” and “DJ Rentals Memphis” are narrower, so you face fewer strong competitors and can dominate with one clear page.

| Factor | Corporate DJ Memphis / DJ Rentals Memphis | Memphis Wedding DJ |
|--------|-------------------------------------------|--------------------|
| **Competition** | Fewer businesses have a dedicated, well-optimized page for these exact phrases. You do → you win. | Many DJs, venues, and directories target “Memphis Wedding DJ.” More domains competing for the same query. |
| **Search volume & intent** | Lower volume, very specific intent. One strong page (yours) is often enough to rank #1. | Higher volume, high commercial intent. Google has more “candidates” and is pickier about relevance, depth, and authority. |
| **Cannibalization (past)** | You had one clear page per phrase; no internal splitting. | You had several pages (homepage, about, contact, wedding-dj-memphis-tn, best-wedding-dj-memphis) using “Memphis Wedding DJ” or close variants → relevance and link equity were split. We fixed this so `/memphis-wedding-dj` is the single authority. |
| **Backlinks / authority** | Fewer competitors likely have strong backlink profiles for these niches. Your page can win on content + decent authority. | Top results for “Memphis Wedding DJ” may have more backlinks (directories, venue sites, wedding sites). You need both great on-page and more off-page authority over time. |
| **Differentiation** | “Corporate DJ Memphis” and “DJ Rentals Memphis” are clear, narrow intents. Your pages match them well and stand out. | “Memphis Wedding DJ” is a head term; Google may still be testing different results. Improving position (you’re ~page 2–4) requires stronger relevance, CTR, and/or authority. |

**What to do**

1. **Keep the cannibalization fix** – Only `/memphis-wedding-dj` should “own” “Memphis Wedding DJ” in title/H1. No new pages targeting that phrase.
2. **Strengthen the pillar page** – More FAQs (with FAQ schema), clear answers in the first 100 words, internal links from other wedding pages and blog posts to `/memphis-wedding-dj`.
3. **Improve CTR** – You already improved the description (“Wedding DJs in Memphis,” “Wedding DJ near me,” CTA). Monitor GSC; if CTR stays low, test small title/description tweaks without changing the leading “Memphis Wedding DJ” phrase.
4. **Build authority** – Earn links from Memphis wedding venues, planners, blogs, and directories. Reviews and citations (NAP) also help.
5. **Be patient** – Wedding DJ is a competitive head term. Moving from page 2–4 to #1 often takes months of consistent content, links, and relevance; you’re already doing the right on-page work.

**Bottom line:** You dominate the two smaller ponds because you have the best, clearest page for each. For “Memphis Wedding DJ” you’re in a bigger pond with more competitors; consolidating to one pillar and improving content/CTR/links is the path to eventually winning there too.

| Cluster | Example queries | Primary page(s) | Meta / content focus |
|---------|-----------------|-----------------|----------------------|
| **Wedding DJ Memphis** | wedding djs in memphis, wedding dj memphis tn, wedding dj near me, memphis wedding dj | `/memphis-wedding-dj`, `/wedding-dj-memphis-tn` | Use exact phrases in title + description; “500+ weddings,” “same-day quote,” CTA. |
| **DJs / DJ near me** | djs near me, local djs near me, dj memphis, dj in memphis, dj company near me | `/dj-near-me-memphis`, homepage | “DJs near you in Memphis,” “local Memphis DJs,” neighborhoods. |
| **DJ service(s)** | dj service, dj services, dj services near me, disc jockey services | `/services`, homepage | “Professional DJ services,” “weddings, corporate, parties.” |
| **Wedding DJ cost / pricing** | wedding dj cost, average price for wedding dj, how much does a wedding dj cost | `/memphis-dj-pricing-guide`, `/memphis-wedding-dj-prices-2025` | “Wedding DJ cost,” “average price,” “transparent pricing,” “free quote.” |
| **DJ rentals** | dj rentals, dj rental, rent dj equipment for wedding, dj equipment near me | `/dj-rentals-memphis` | “DJ & equipment rental Memphis,” “speakers, lighting, wedding.” |

| **School dance DJ** | dj for school dance, high school dance dj, school dance djs | `/school-dances` | “School dance DJ,” “prom, homecoming, Memphis.” |

### 2.4 Suggested title/description tweaks by page (from top queries)

- **`/memphis-wedding-dj`**  
  - Title: Include “Wedding DJs in Memphis” or “Wedding DJ Memphis TN” + social proof.  
  - Description: “Wedding DJs in Memphis” + “wedding dj near me” + cost/pricing hint + CTA.

- **`/dj-near-me-memphis`**  
  - Title: “DJs Near Me Memphis TN | Local Wedding & Party DJs | M10 DJ Company” (or similar).  
  - Description: “Local DJs near you in Memphis,” “djs near me,” “wedding & party DJs,” neighborhoods + CTA.

- **`/services`**  
  - Title: “Professional DJ Services Memphis | Weddings, Corporate, Parties | M10 DJ”  
  - Description: “DJ service” / “dj services near me,” “disc jockey services,” event types + CTA.

- **`/memphis-dj-pricing-guide`** and **`/memphis-wedding-dj-prices-2025`**  
  - Title: Include “Wedding DJ Cost,” “Average Price for Wedding DJ,” or “How Much Does a Wedding DJ Cost.”  
  - Description: “Typical cost for wedding DJ,” “average price,” “transparent pricing,” “free quote.”

- **`/dj-rentals-memphis`**  
  - **Protected – already #1 for “DJ Rentals Memphis”.** Do not change title/description. Keep: “DJ Rentals Memphis from $75/Day | Speakers, Mics, Lighting | M10” and current description. Add secondary keywords only in body/FAQs/keywords array.

- **`/corporate-events`**  
  - **Protected – already #1 for “Corporate DJ Memphis”.** Do not change title/description. Keep: “Corporate DJ Memphis | Professional Corporate Event DJ Services | M10 DJ Company” and current description. Add secondary keywords only in body/FAQs/keywords array.

- **`/school-dances`**  
  - Title: “School Dance DJ Memphis | Prom & Homecoming DJ | M10 DJ Company”  
  - Description: “DJ for school dance,” “high school dance DJ,” “Memphis” + CTA.

Use these patterns so the **exact phrases** from the top-query list appear naturally in title and description (without stuffing). Re-check GSC in 4–6 weeks for CTR and position changes on these queries.

## 3. Top pages from GSC (by path)

GSC reports the same path under both **www** and **non-www** (and sometimes with/without trailing slash). Below, paths are grouped so you can see total impact and where to fix meta.

### 3.1 Top pages by clicks (consolidated by path)

| Path | Clicks | Impressions | Note |
|------|--------|-------------|------|
| `/dj-rentals-memphis` | 16 | 1,561 | **#1 by clicks** – protect and strengthen meta. |
| `/` (homepage) | 30 | 5,391 | 15+15 clicks, 4,346+1,045 impr. (www + non-www). |
| `/dj-near-me-memphis` | 4 | 3,812 | 4+0 clicks, 3,679+133 impr. |
| `/blog/memphis-wedding-dj-cost-guide-2025` | 4 | 3,672 | Strong blog performer. |
| `/corporate-events` | 3 | 565 | |
| `/djbenmurray` | 3 | 352 | **No hyphen** – see §3.4. |
| `/memphis-dj-pricing-guide` | 1 | 921 | High impressions, low CTR → improve title/description. |
| `/services` | 1 | 1,614 | 1+0 clicks, 781+833 impr. – **833 impr. with 0 clicks** = big CTR opportunity. |
| `/bartlett` | 1 | 362 | |
| `/best-wedding-dj-memphis` | 1 | 215 | |
| `/dj-ben-murray` | 1 | 110 | 1+0 clicks, 104+6 impr. (canonical is this URL). |
| `/memphis-wedding-dj-prices-2025` | 1 | 152 | 1+0, 49+103 impr. |
| `/holiday-parties` | 1 | 39 | |
| `/dj-collierville-tn` | 1 | 80 | 1+0, 30+50 impr. |
| `/blog/memphis-wedding-success-story-sarah-michael` | 1 | 14 | |
| `/vendors` | 1 | 8 | |
| `/photo-booth-rental-memphis` | 1 | 5 | |

### 3.2 High impressions, 0 clicks (fix meta first)

| Path | Impressions | Priority |
|------|-------------|----------|
| `/services` (www) | 833 | **High** – same page gets 781 impr. with 1 click on non-www; align canonical and improve meta. |
| `/wedding-dj-memphis-tn` | 562 | **High** – core wedding page; add “wedding dj memphis tn” + CTA to title/description. |
| `/private-parties` | 317 | Medium |
| `/school-dances` | 295 | Medium – “dj for school dance” queries; add to title/description. |
| `/east-memphis` | 310 | 267+43 (www + non-www) |
| `/olive-branch` | 171 | |
| `/contact` | 149 | |
| `/memphis-event-dj-services` | 115 | |
| `/southaven` | 110 | |
| `/collierville` | 88 | |
| `/home` | 61 | Redirect to `/` or noindex if duplicate. |
| `/about` | 48 | |
| `/memphis-dj-services` | 47 | 35+12 |
| `/blog/memphis-wedding-songs-2025` | 33 | |
| Venues, terms, location pages | various | Lower – improve incrementally. |

### 3.3 www vs non-www

- **Homepage:** 4,346 impr. (www) + 1,045 (non-www) = 5,391 total; 15 clicks each = 30 total.
- **Same path appears twice** for many URLs (e.g. `/services`, `/dj-near-me-memphis`, `/dj-ben-murray`). That usually means:
  - GSC property includes both hostnames, or
  - Canonical/redirect isn’t fully consolidating in Google’s eyes.
- **Recommendation:** Pick one canonical host (e.g. `https://www.m10djcompany.com`) and ensure:
  - All internal links and sitemap use that host.
  - 301 redirect from `m10djcompany.com` → `www.m10djcompany.com` (or the opposite) so one URL is canonical.
  - In GSC, use the “URL prefix” property for the chosen canonical so you don’t double-count.

### 3.4 `/djbenmurray` (no hyphen) – 3 clicks, 352 impressions

- GSC shows **`https://www.m10djcompany.com/djbenmurray`** (no hyphen) with 3 clicks and 352 impressions.
- Your real page is **`/dj-ben-murray`** (with hyphen); sitemap and internal links use the hyphenated URL.
- **Action:** If `/djbenmurray` is not already a 301 redirect to `/dj-ben-murray`, add one so:
  - Users and Google consolidate to one URL.
  - Link equity and future impressions go to the canonical page.

---

## 4. Quick wins (implemented or recommended)

### 4.1 Homepage meta (CTR-focused)

**Current (in code):**  
- Title: `Memphis DJ Company | Professional DJ Services | M10 DJ Company`  
- Description: `Memphis premier DJ and entertainment company serving all event types...`

**Recommended (wedding + local + CTA):**  
- Title: `Best Wedding DJs in Memphis TN | M10 DJ Company | 500+ Weddings | Same-Day Quotes`  
- Description: `Memphis's #1 Wedding DJ Company ⭐ 500+ Successful Weddings ⭐ Same-Day Quotes! Professional Memphis wedding DJs. Call (901) 410-2020 now!`

**Why:** Matches high-intent queries (“best wedding DJ Memphis”), adds social proof (500+), clear CTA, and a light visual hook (⭐). Aligns with the strategy in `SEO_OPTIMIZATION_SUMMARY_2025.md`.

**Where:** `pages/index.js` – `<SEO title=... description=... />` (and optional `generateStructuredData` description if you use it in schema).

### 4.2 Google Search Console verification

**Current:** `app/layout.tsx` has `verification: { google: 'your-google-verification-code' }`.

**Action:**  
- Replace with the **real** meta tag value from GSC (Search Console → Settings → Ownership verification), or  
- Remove the key entirely if you verify via DNS/HTML file.  
Having a literal placeholder in the HTML is unnecessary and can look unprofessional.

### 4.3 Root layout default title/description

**Current:** `app/layout.tsx` uses a generic default:  
`M10 DJ Company - Professional Event Entertainment in Memphis` and a long generic description.

**Note:** On m10djcompany.com, the homepage is served by **Pages Router** (`pages/index.js`), which uses the `<SEO>` component and overrides with its own title/description. So the root layout default mainly affects:  
- Other App Router pages that don’t set their own metadata, and  
- Fallback if something fails.  

**Recommendation:** Keep layout generic or slightly wedding-leaning; ensure every important **page** (especially wedding/location pages) has its own specific title and description. No need to make the root layout description long or keyword-heavy.

---

## 5. Content & on-page (medium-term)

### 5.1 FAQs

- **Action:** Add 10–15 FAQs per key page (e.g. `/memphis-wedding-dj`, `/dj-near-me-memphis`) using real questions from GSC “Queries” and “People also ask.”
- **Format:** Use FAQ schema (you already have FAQ schema elsewhere) so answers can show as rich results.
- **Effect:** Better relevance, more chances for snippets, improved E-E-A-T.

### 5.2 H1 / first paragraph

- **Homepage:** You already have a strong “Looking for the best Memphis DJ?” and wedding-focused intro. Keep that.
- **Pillar pages:** Ensure H1 and first ~100 words directly answer the main query (e.g. “Wedding DJs in Memphis TN” on `/memphis-wedding-dj`).

### 5.3 Internal links

- Homepage → `/memphis-wedding-dj`, `/dj-near-me-memphis`, `/wedding-dj-memphis-tn`, `/contact`, `/pricing`.
- Each location/service page ↔ related wedding and “near me” pages.
- Avoid creating extra thin “wedding DJ” pages; you already have a clear set (see `SEO_OPTIMIZATION_SUMMARY_2025.md`).

---

## 6. Technical & discovery

### 6.1 Sitemap & indexing

- **Sitemap:** `app/sitemap.ts` already returns M10 URLs when on m10djcompany.com (static + location + venue + blog). Keep submitting `https://www.m10djcompany.com/sitemap.xml` in GSC.
- **Indexing:** Use GSC URL Inspection for high-value pages (see `utils/gscIndexingHelper.ts` – critical/high list) and “Request indexing” after meaningful changes.

### 6.2 Robots

- `app/robots.ts` is domain-aware and allows crawling of marketing content; no change needed unless you add new sensitive paths.

### 6.3 Schema

- LocalBusiness, Organization, reviews, FAQs are in place. Keep them; add FAQ schema when you add new FAQ blocks.

---

## 7. What to track in GSC (aligned with your sheet)

- **Performance tab:** Clicks, Impressions, CTR, Average position (by page and query).
- **Queries:** Export and compare “wedding dj memphis,” “djs near me,” “memphis dj,” “best wedding dj memphis,” etc., month over month.
- **Pages:** Which URLs get the most impressions and which convert to clicks. Double down on meta and content for those.
- **Enhancements:** Rich results (FAQ, Local Business, etc.) – fix any errors or warnings.

---

## 8. Cross-product note

- **Scope:** All changes above apply only to **M10 DJ Company** (m10djcompany.com).
- **TipJar / DJ Dash:** Sitemap and metadata are domain-separated in `app/sitemap.ts` and `app/layout.tsx` (via host). No impact on tipjar.live or djdash.net.

---

## 9. Action checklist

| Priority | Action | Owner |
|----------|--------|--------|

### 9.1 Request indexing in GSC (after deploy)

After deploying these SEO changes, request indexing in [Google Search Console](https://search.google.com/search-console) for the URLs that changed, so Google recrawls them sooner:

1. Open GSC → **URL Inspection** (left sidebar).
2. Enter each URL below and click **Request indexing**.
3. Prioritize the pillar and high-opportunity pages.

**Suggested URLs (in order):**

- `https://www.m10djcompany.com/memphis-wedding-dj`
- `https://www.m10djcompany.com/dj-near-me-memphis`
- `https://www.m10djcompany.com/`

- `https://www.m10djcompany.com/school-dances`
- `https://www.m10djcompany.com/private-parties`

**Note:** After the www redirect is live, traffic to `m10djcompany.com` will 301 to `www.m10djcompany.com`. Use one GSC property (e.g. URL prefix `https://www.m10djcompany.com`) so you don’t double-count.

### 9.2 "URL is unknown to Google" / Page not indexed

If URL Inspection shows **"URL is not on Google"**, **"Page is not indexed: URL is unknown to Google"**, **"No referring sitemaps detected"**, and **"No referring page detected"**, Google has not discovered this URL yet. Do the following:

1. **Use the www canonical URL** – Inspect and request indexing for **`https://www.m10djcompany.com/...`** (with `www`). After the redirect is live, non-www URLs 301 to www, so the URL Google should index is the www one.
2. **Submit the sitemap** – In GSC (URL prefix property **`https://www.m10djcompany.com`**), add **Sitemaps** → **`https://www.m10djcompany.com/sitemap.xml`**. The sitemap lists www URLs; then "Referring sitemaps" can show for those URLs.
3. **Request indexing** – In URL Inspection, paste the exact URL (e.g. `https://www.m10djcompany.com/memphis-wedding-dj`) and click **Request indexing**.
4. **Confirm URL is in sitemap** – Open `https://www.m10djcompany.com/sitemap.xml` and verify the URL appears (our sitemap includes static pages, location pages, venue pages, blog posts).
5. **Domain property** – If you use a Domain property (`m10djcompany.com`), add the sitemap as `https://www.m10djcompany.com/sitemap.xml`, then inspect and request indexing for the **www** version of each URL.

**Summary:** Use **www** URLs when inspecting and requesting indexing; submit **`https://www.m10djcompany.com/sitemap.xml`** (www URL prefix property recommended).

### 9.3 "Redirect error" – non-www URLs (expected, not a bug)

If GSC shows **"Redirect error"** with examples like **`https://m10djcompany.com/germantown`** and **`https://m10djcompany.com/memphis-wedding-dj`** (no www), that is **expected** after consolidating to www.

**What’s happening**
- We 301 redirect **m10djcompany.com** → **www.m10djcompany.com** (same path).
- Google requests the non-www URL, gets a 301, and does **not** index that URL (redirects are not indexed).
- The URL that **should** be indexed is the **destination**: **`https://www.m10djcompany.com/memphis-wedding-dj`**, **`https://www.m10djcompany.com/germantown`**, etc.

**What to do**
1. **Mark as "Done fixing"** – The redirect is intentional. You’re not trying to get the non-www URLs indexed; you want the www URLs indexed.
2. **Track the www property** – Use a **URL prefix** property **`https://www.m10djcompany.com`**, submit **`https://www.m10djcompany.com/sitemap.xml`**, and use URL Inspection / Request indexing for **www** URLs. Coverage and "Redirect error" for non-www will improve as Google crawls and indexes the www versions.
3. **Don’t remove the redirect** – Keeping the 301 is correct so one canonical host (www) is used everywhere.

**Summary:** "Redirect error" for **m10djcompany.com/...** is expected. Ensure **www.m10djcompany.com/...** URLs are in the sitemap, submitted in GSC, and requested for indexing; those are the URLs that will be indexed and served.

### 9.4 Live URL test – what it does and doesn’t mean

GSC’s **Test live URL** fetches the URL in real time and reports whether Google-InspectionTool can access it. Use it to confirm fetch/rendering; do **not** treat a valid result as a guarantee of indexing.

**What the live test does**
- Follows redirects (then tests the final page; it does **not** show the final URL).
- Reports availability and indexability for the fetched version.
- Can show a screenshot of the rendered page (only when the fetch succeeds).

**What the live test does NOT do**
- Does **not** check sitemaps or referring pages.
- Does **not** test for duplicates/alternates (duplicates may not be indexed).
- Does **not** check quality/security guidelines, manual actions, or content removals.
- **Valid/warning verdict** = Google-InspectionTool can access the page; it does **not** guarantee the URL will be indexed.

**For indexing, Google also requires (among other things)**  
- No manual actions or legal issues.  
- Page is unique or is the canonical for a set; not treated as a duplicate of another indexed URL.  
- Quality high enough to warrant indexing.

**If URL status is "URL is not on Google"** – expand the **Availability** section in URL Inspection and use the label:

| Availability label / check | Meaning | What to do |
|----------------------------|--------|------------|
| **URL is unknown to Google** | Not yet discovered | Submit sitemap (www), request indexing for the www URL. |
| **Crawl allowed? No** | Blocked by robots.txt | Fix robots.txt so the path is allowed for Googlebot. |
| **Indexing allowed? No** | noindex tag or header | Remove noindex from the page (or X-Robots-Tag header). |

**Summary:** Use **Test live URL** to confirm the page is reachable and renderable. Use **Availability** (and Crawl allowed? / Indexing allowed?) to diagnose why a URL isn’t on Google. A valid live test is necessary but not sufficient for indexing.

### 9.5 www version still not indexed – checklist

If **https://www.m10djcompany.com/memphis-wedding-dj** (or other www URLs) are still not indexed after submitting the sitemap and requesting indexing, work through this list.

**1. Confirm www is reachable (DNS + hosting)**  
- In a browser, open **https://www.m10djcompany.com/memphis-wedding-dj**. You should see the page (200), not 404 or a connection error.  
- If www doesn’t load or shows a host error, **www is not set up correctly**. Add **www** as a domain in your host (e.g. Vercel: Project → Settings → Domains → add `www.m10djcompany.com`). Ensure DNS has a CNAME (or A) for **www** pointing to the same place as the apex domain.  
- If only the apex (**m10djcompany.com**) was in your host and we redirect apex → www, then requests to www must be served by the same app; the host must accept **www** as a domain.

**2. GSC: Availability and live test**  
- **URL Inspection** → enter **`https://www.m10djcompany.com/memphis-wedding-dj`**.  
- Expand **Availability**. If **Crawl allowed?** is No → fix robots.txt. If **Indexing allowed?** is No → remove noindex (or X-Robots-Tag).  
- Run **Test live URL**. If the test fails (4xx/5xx, unreachable), fix that first. A **valid** live test only means the tool can fetch the page; it does not guarantee indexing (see §9.4).  
- Use **View tested page** / Screenshot to confirm the page renders as intended.

**3. GSC: www property and sitemap**  
- Add a **URL prefix** property **`https://www.m10djcompany.com`** if needed.  
- **Sitemaps** → add **`https://www.m10djcompany.com/sitemap.xml`** → Submit.  
- For many new/updated URLs, submitting the sitemap (with `<lastmod>` on updated URLs) is better than requesting indexing for each URL; there is a daily limit on index requests.

**4. Request indexing**  
- In the **www** property, URL Inspection for **`https://www.m10djcompany.com/memphis-wedding-dj`** → **Request indexing** (only if the live test is valid; otherwise the button may be disabled).  
- Indexing can take from a few days to a couple of weeks; submitting does not guarantee inclusion.

**5. Other reasons a page might not be indexed**  
- **Duplicate** – If Google treats the page as a duplicate of another URL, it may not index it; ensure canonical points to this www URL and that you're not serving the same content under multiple URLs without canonical.  
- **Quality / manual actions** – Check **Manual Actions** and **Security Issues** in GSC; fix any issues reported there.

**Summary:** If www isn't indexed, confirm reachability (browser + GSC Availability + Test live URL), fix Crawl allowed? / Indexing allowed? if needed, then use the www property, sitemap, and Request indexing. Remember: valid live test = fetch OK, not "will be indexed."

## 10. Duplicate content prevention (Google penalty risk)

Google can penalize or demote sites when **multiple pages have substantially the same content**. Each URL should be clearly distinct so Google can choose the right page for each query and avoid treating pages as duplicates.

### 10.1 Rule: one URL = one unique page

For every indexable URL on m10djcompany.com:

1. **Unique title** – No two pages should share the same `<title>`.
2. **Unique meta description** – Each page should have a distinct description (see §1.1, §2.4 for wedding cluster and location meta).
3. **Unique H1** – The main heading should be specific to that page (e.g. only `/memphis-wedding-dj` leads with "Memphis Wedding DJ"; others use "Wedding DJ Memphis TN", "Best Wedding DJ Memphis", etc.).
4. **Meaningfully unique body** – The **first 200–300 words** (and key sections) should not be a copy-paste from another URL. Shared stats (e.g. "15+ years", "500+ weddings") and short CTAs are fine; long identical paragraphs are not.

### 10.2 Similar-page clusters (how we keep them unique)

| Cluster | Pages | How we avoid duplication |
|--------|--------|---------------------------|
| **Wedding DJ (Memphis)** | `/memphis-wedding-dj`, `/wedding-dj-memphis-tn`, `/best-wedding-dj-memphis`, `/dj-near-me-memphis`, `/memphis-wedding-dj-prices-2025` | Different title/H1 per page (§1.1). Different intro copy, service lists, testimonials, and FAQs. Pillar = `/memphis-wedding-dj`; others link to it with anchor "Memphis Wedding DJ" but do not repeat its full positioning. |
| **Location pages** | `/[slug]` (e.g. `/germantown`, `/collierville`, `/cordova`) | Each location has its own `description` and `weddingDescription` in `locationData` in `pages/[slug].js`. Hero paragraph includes `{loc.name}` so the second sentence is unique per location. No duplicate `locationData` keys (e.g. only one `cordova` entry). |
| **Service pages** | `/corporate-events`, `/private-parties`, `/school-dances`, `/memphis-dj-services`, etc. | Each has its own title, description, H1, package names, and body copy. Shared component structure is fine; copy and value props should differ. |
| **Blog / pricing** | `/memphis-dj-pricing-guide`, `/memphis-wedding-dj-prices-2025`, blog posts | Pricing guides have distinct angles (general guide vs 2025 wedding prices). Blog posts are unique articles. |

### 10.3 Checklist when adding or editing a page

- [ ] **Title** – Is this `<title>` used on any other page? If yes, change it.
- [ ] **Meta description** – Is this description identical or near-identical to another page? If yes, rewrite.
- [ ] **H1** – Does another page use the same H1? If yes, make this one specific to this URL.
- [ ] **Intro / hero** – Are the first 2–3 paragraphs the same as another page? If yes, rewrite so the main message and angle are unique (location name, service focus, or audience).
- [ ] **Location data** – If adding a location to `pages/[slug].js`, ensure the slug is unique and `description` / `weddingDescription` are written for this location only (no pasting from another city).

### 10.4 What’s acceptable to repeat

- Short boilerplate: "Call (901) 410-2020", "Get your free quote", "Professional equipment and experienced DJs."
- Stats and facts: "15+ years", "500+ weddings", "27+ Memphis venues" (used in different sentences/contexts across pages).
- Navigation, footer, and component structure.
- One canonical page for a topic and other pages that briefly mention it and link to it (e.g. "Best Wedding DJ Memphis" page that links to "/memphis-wedding-dj" with anchor "Memphis Wedding DJ").

**Summary:** Every indexable URL should have a unique title, meta description, H1, and meaningfully unique body. We keep wedding-DJ, location, and service clusters distinct by design; when adding or editing pages, use the checklist above so similar pages never share duplicated content.

## 11. Feb 2026 ranking snapshot & on-page audit

### 11.1 Current ranking snapshot (high-intent queries)

| Query | Status | Notes |
|-------|--------|------|
| **wedding DJ Memphis TN** | Page 1–2, not top 5 | Dominated by directories (WeddingWire/The Knot, The Bash, WeddingRule) + DNA Entertainment, DJ Zoom, Perfection DJs. Branded/direct hits help. |
| **best wedding DJ Memphis** | Rarely in curated lists | Mostly list articles; site cracks newer 2026 roundups when included. |
| **M10 DJ Company** (branded) | #1–3 | Owned. |

**Gap:** Visible for branded/long-tail; losing generic/high-competition volume to aggregators and higher-review competitors. Levers: **review volume** + **intent-optimized titles** (and meta).

### 11.2 Homepage on-page fixes (implemented)

| Element | Before | After (implemented) |
|--------|--------|----------------------|
| **Title** | Generic / long | "Memphis Wedding DJ \| 500+ Events, 4.8★ \| M10 DJ Company" (CTR + keywords) |
| **Meta description** | Generic, weak CTA | "Premier Memphis wedding DJ with 500+ events and 4.8 Google stars. Custom playlists, MC services, uplighting & more. Book your perfect reception today!" |
| **H2 subheadline** | None | "Trusted Memphis Wedding DJ – 15+ Years, 500+ Celebrations" (wedding intent) |
| **Keywords** | General DJ | Added "memphis wedding dj", "wedding dj memphis tn", "best wedding dj memphis", "wedding djs in memphis" to meta + copy |
| **Schema** | Homepage already has LocalBusiness + Organization + WebSite + AggregateRating | No change; ensure reviewCount/rating in seoConfig match GBP when updated. |
| **Internal linking** | Services link | Added "See Wedding Packages" CTA → /memphis-wedding-dj; kept "View All Services" → /services. |

### 11.3 Technical / local SEO quick hits (reference)

- **Google Business Profile:** Aim for 60+ reviews by end of Q2 2026 (post-event review automation).
- **NAP:** Use exact same name, address, phone everywhere: "M10 DJ Company", Memphis TN, +19014102020.
- **Directories:** Prioritize The Knot, Eventective, WeddingRule, local Memphis "best of" roundups; submit for 2026 "Best of Memphis Weddings" where they accept submissions.
- **Content:** Add blog posts (e.g. "2026 Memphis Wedding DJ Trends", "How to Choose a Wedding DJ in Memphis") for long-tail traffic.
- **Core Web Vitals:** Compress hero images &lt; 200 KB, lazy loading; target 90+ mobile on PageSpeed Insights.

### 11.4 Next-step plan (by priority)

| Priority | Actions | Owner |
|----------|---------|--------|
| **Immediate (1–2 weeks)** | Homepage title, meta, H2, keywords, "See Wedding Packages" CTA (§11.2) | ✅ Done. Request indexing in GSC for homepage. |
| **Short-term (1–2 months)** | Aggressive Google review collection; claim/optimize 3–5 more wedding directories; NAP audit. | Marketing / Ops |
| **Medium-term (3–6 months)** | Content plan (blog + gallery); outreach for "best of" features; consider post-event review automation. | Marketing |

**Summary:** Homepage is updated for CTR and wedding intent. Biggest levers next: **review volume** (60+ target) and **directory/roundup presence** so you compete with aggregators and "best of" lists.

---

**Summary:** Impressions are trending up; the biggest lever now is **CTR** (better titles/descriptions) and **position** (FAQs, relevance, internal links). Start with homepage meta and verification, then layer in FAQs and query-led meta on pillar pages.
