# Response Script - With Website Redesign Context

## The Context
- Monogram wasn't supposed to be in Package 2 originally
- Extra hour was replaced with monogram to maintain value
- Now fixing the website/package structure
- Removing monogram = correcting an error
- Extra hour = the correct item that should be there

## Recommended Response

### Option 1: Frame as Correction (Recommended)

**Message:**
> "Perfect! I've removed the monogram projection from Package 2, so your total is now $2,250.
> 
> I should mention - we're actually in the process of redesigning our website and packages. The monogram projection wasn't originally supposed to be part of Package 2 - it was temporarily added to replace the extra hour while we updated our pricing structure. Now that we're fixing the packages, we're removing the monogram and restoring the extra hour, which is what should have been there all along.
> 
> So the extra hour is actually the correct item for Package 2 - it ensures seamless transitions between your ceremony, cocktail hour, and reception. Most couples find they need this buffer time for photos, guest arrival, or unexpected delays. Without it, you risk rushing between events or potentially paying overtime fees ($150/hour) if things run long.
> 
> Package 2 at $2,250 (with the monogram removed) is the correct package structure. The extra hour is a core part of the package and is included at the discounted bundle rate. Would you like to proceed with Package 2 at $2,250?"

**Why this works:**
- ✅ Frames monogram removal as "fixing an error" not "customization"
- ✅ Explains that extra hour is the CORRECT item
- ✅ Makes it clear this is a one-time correction
- ✅ Sets boundary: extra hour stays (it's supposed to be there)
- ✅ Doesn't look inconsistent - it's correcting the package

### Option 2: Softer Version (If Needed)

**Message:**
> "Perfect! I've removed the monogram projection from Package 2, so your total is now $2,250.
> 
> Just to give you some context - we're in the process of redesigning our website and packages. The monogram projection was actually added to Package 2 temporarily while we updated our pricing structure. The original Package 2 was supposed to include the extra hour instead of the monogram. Now that we're fixing the packages, we're correcting this - removing the monogram and keeping the extra hour, which is what should have been there all along.
> 
> The extra hour is really valuable - it ensures seamless transitions between your ceremony, cocktail hour, and reception. Most couples find they need this buffer time for photos, guest arrival, or unexpected delays. Without it, you risk rushing between events or potentially paying overtime fees.
> 
> So Package 2 at $2,250 (with the monogram removed) is the correct, updated package structure. The extra hour is included at the discounted bundle rate. Would you like to proceed with that?"

**Why this works:**
- ✅ Same framing but softer language
- ✅ Still explains it's a correction
- ✅ Maintains boundary on extra hour
- ✅ Professional and friendly

### Option 3: If She Still Pushes (Hold Firm)

**If she says:** "But can't you just remove the extra hour too?"

**Response:**
> "I understand the question. The monogram removal was actually correcting an error in our package structure - it wasn't supposed to be there originally. The extra hour is the correct item that should be in Package 2, and it's included at the discounted bundle rate.
> 
> Our packages are designed as complete solutions, and the bundle discount applies when you take the package as-is. If we remove core items like the extra hour, we'd need to price it at a la carte rates, which would actually cost more than the package.
> 
> Package 2 at $2,250 (with the monogram removed) is the correct, updated package structure. The extra hour is a core part of the package and ensures your wedding day flows smoothly. Would you like to proceed with that?"

**Key points:**
- Reinforce it's a correction, not customization
- Extra hour is the correct item
- Packages work as complete solutions
- Assume the sale

## Why This Framing Works

### Before (Without Context):
- "I removed monogram, now you want to remove extra hour"
- Looks like: "I said yes once, why not again?"
- Problem: Negotiation spiral

### After (With Context):
- "I removed monogram because it was an error"
- "Extra hour is the correct item"
- Looks like: "This was a one-time correction, not ongoing customization"
- Solution: Clear boundary

---

## Key Messaging Points

1. **Monogram removal = Correction**
   - "Wasn't supposed to be there"
   - "Temporarily added"
   - "Now fixing it"

2. **Extra hour = Correct item**
   - "Should have been there all along"
   - "Core part of the package"
   - "Included at discounted rate"

3. **One-time correction**
   - "We're fixing the packages"
   - "This is the correct structure"
   - Not: "I can remove items for you"

4. **Boundary set**
   - "Packages are complete solutions"
   - "Bundle discount applies to complete package"
   - "Extra hour stays"

---

## Expected Outcome

**Best case:**
- Client accepts Package 2 at $2,250
- Understands it was a correction, not customization
- No further removal requests
- Relationship maintained
- Sale closed

**If she still pushes:**
- Hold firm: "The extra hour is the correct item for Package 2"
- Offer alternative: "Would you like to consider Package 1 instead?"
- Maintain boundary: "Packages work best as complete solutions"

---

## Long-Term: Update Package Structure

**Going forward:**
1. ✅ Remove monogram from Package 2 (already done)
2. ✅ Keep extra hour in Package 2 (correct item)
3. ✅ Update website/pricing to reflect correct structure
4. ✅ Set policy: Packages are fixed-price bundles
5. ✅ Only allow removal of true add-ons (like monogram), not core services

---

## Summary

**For this client:**

This makes it clear:
- ✅ Monogram removal = one-time correction
- ✅ Extra hour = correct item, stays
