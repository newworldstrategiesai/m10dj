# Enhanced Notification System Setup Guide

## Overview
This enhanced notification system prevents missed leads by implementing multiple redundancy layers, retry logic, and comprehensive monitoring.

## Critical Issue Resolved
**Problem**: SMS notifications were failing silently, causing missed leads and potential lost business.

**Solution**: Multi-layered notification system with:
- SMS retry logic with multiple phone numbers
- Email backup notifications
- Database logging and monitoring
- Critical failure alerts
- Health check system

## Required Environment Variables

Add these to your `.env.local` file:

```env
# === PRIMARY NOTIFICATION SETTINGS ===

ADMIN_PHONE_NUMBER=+19014102020

# Backup admin phone numbers (optional but recommended)
BACKUP_ADMIN_PHONE=
EMERGENCY_CONTACT_PHONE=

# Primary admin email
ADMIN_EMAIL=m10djcompany@gmail.com

# Backup admin emails (optional but recommended)
BACKUP_ADMIN_EMAIL=
EMERGENCY_CONTACT_EMAIL=

# === TWILIO SMS CONFIGURATION ===

# Twilio Account SID (required for SMS)
TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID=

# Twilio Auth Token (required for SMS)
TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN=

# Twilio Phone Number (required for SMS, format: +1XXXXXXXXXX)
TWILIO_PHONE_NUMBER=

# === EMAIL CONFIGURATION ===

# Resend API Key (required for email notifications)
RESEND_API_KEY=

# === CRITICAL ALERT CONFIGURATION ===

# Webhook URL for critical alerts (optional - for Slack, Discord, etc.)
CRITICAL_ALERT_WEBHOOK=

# API key for health check endpoint (generate a random string)
ADMIN_API_KEY=your-secure-random-string-here

# === DAILY DIGEST CONFIGURATION ===

# Cron job secret for Vercel (generate a random string)
CRON_SECRET=your-secure-cron-secret-here

# Enable/disable daily digest (true/false)
ENABLE_DAILY_DIGEST=true
```

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Twilio SMS Setup
1. Sign up at [https://www.twilio.com/](https://www.twilio.com/)
2. Get Account SID and Auth Token from Console Dashboard
3. Purchase a phone number for `TWILIO_PHONE_NUMBER`
4. Verify your admin phone number in Twilio Console
5. Ensure account has sufficient balance

### 2. Resend Email Setup
1. Sign up at [https://resend.com/](https://resend.com/)
2. Create API key in dashboard
3. Verify your sending domain (optional but recommended)

### 3. Database Migration
Run the notification logging migration:
```bash
# Apply the notification_log table migration
supabase db push
```

### 4. Phone Number Format
All phone numbers must be in E.164 format:
- US numbers: `+1` followed by 10 digits
- Example: `+19014102020`

## Features

### Multi-Layer Notification System
1. **SMS with Retry Logic**: Up to 3 attempts across multiple phone numbers
2. **Email Notifications**: High-priority emails with failure alerts
3. **Database Logging**: Track all notification attempts
4. **Critical Alerts**: Webhook notifications for total failures

### Daily Digest System
- **Automated Daily SMS**: Summary sent every day at 1:00 PM CST
- **Lead Analytics**: Count of submissions, event type breakdown
- **Trend Analysis**: Comparison with previous day
- **System Health**: Notification success rate monitoring
- **Recent Leads**: Preview of latest submissions with timestamps

### Health Monitoring
- `/api/test-notifications` - Health check endpoint
- `/api/daily-digest` - Manual digest triggering
- Admin dashboard monitoring component
- Automatic failure detection and alerting
- Success rate tracking

### Redundancy Features
- Multiple admin phone numbers
- Multiple admin email addresses
- Fallback notification methods
- Retry logic with delays

## Testing the System

### 1. Health Check API
```bash
curl -X POST https://your-domain.com/api/test-notifications \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer your-admin-api-key" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json"
```

### 2. Contact Form Test
Submit a test contact form and monitor:
- Console logs for notification attempts
- Admin dashboard for success/failure tracking
- Actual SMS/email delivery

### 3. Daily Digest Test
```bash
curl -X POST https://your-domain.com/api/daily-digest \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer your-admin-api-key" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"action": "test", "testMode": true}'
```

### 4. Monitor Dashboard
Access the notification monitor at `/admin/notifications` to view:
- Real-time system health
- Success rates
- Recent notification logs
- Error details and recommendations

Access the daily digest manager at `/admin/digest` to:
- Send test digest messages
- Manually trigger daily digest
- View digest history and results
- Configure digest settings

## Monitoring and Maintenance

### Daily Checks
- Review notification success rates
- Check for critical failures
- Verify service account balances (Twilio, Resend)

### Weekly Maintenance
- Run health checks
- Review error patterns
- Update backup contact information if needed

### Monthly Reviews
- Analyze notification trends
- Update emergency procedures
- Review and rotate API keys

## Troubleshooting

### SMS Failures
1. Check Twilio account balance
2. Verify phone number formats
3. Check Twilio service status
4. Test with different phone numbers

### Email Failures
1. Verify Resend API key
2. Check sending domain status
3. Review email address formats
4. Check spam/blocked lists

### Total System Failure
1. Check all environment variables
2. Verify third-party service status
3. Review database connectivity
4. Implement manual monitoring temporarily

## Security Considerations

- Never commit actual credentials to version control
- Use strong, unique API keys
- Regularly rotate credentials
- Monitor for unauthorized access
- Set up alerts for critical failures
- Restrict admin API access

## Emergency Procedures

If all automated notifications fail:
1. Check system health via admin dashboard
2. Manually monitor contact form submissions
3. Set up temporary email forwarding
4. Contact service providers for status updates
5. Implement manual lead tracking until resolved

## Files Modified/Created

### New Files
- `utils/notification-system.js` - Enhanced notification logic
- `supabase/migrations/20250101000000_create_notification_log.sql` - Database schema
- `pages/api/test-notifications.js` - Health check endpoint
- `pages/api/admin/notification-logs.js` - Log retrieval API
- `components/admin/NotificationMonitor.jsx` - Monitoring dashboard

### Modified Files
- `pages/api/contact.js` - Integrated enhanced notifications
- Existing SMS and email systems remain as fallbacks

## Success Metrics

Track these metrics to ensure system effectiveness:
- Notification success rate (target: >99%)
- SMS delivery rate (target: >95%)
- Email delivery rate (target: >99%)
- Average response time to leads (target: <1 hour)
- Zero missed critical leads

This enhanced system ensures that you'll never miss another lead due to notification failures!
