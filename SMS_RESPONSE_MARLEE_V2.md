## Recommended Response

**Message to send:**

> "Thanks for catching that date! I'll get that fixed to 10/10 right away.
> 
> About the extra hour - I can remove it. So Package 2 without the monogram would be $2,200 (Package 2 is $2,500, monogram a la carte is $300, so $2,500 - $300 = $2,200).
> 
> Given that, let me help you think through Package 2 vs Package 1:
> 
> **Package 1: $2,000**
> - 4 hours of DJ/MC services at reception only
> - Dance floor lighting & uplighting
> - Additional speaker
> 
> **Package 2 (without monogram): $2,200**
> - 6 hours of DJ/MC services (ceremony + cocktail hour + reception)
> - Ceremony audio (ceremony music + microphones)
> - Cocktail hour music & DJ services
> - All the same lighting as Package 1
> - Additional speaker
> 
> So for $200 more, Package 2 gives you:
> - Ceremony coverage (music + microphones)
> - Cocktail hour coverage
> - Full day seamless flow from ceremony to reception
> 
> If you're having your ceremony and cocktail hour at The Elliot, Package 2 makes sense because you get coverage for your entire day. If your ceremony is elsewhere or you're just doing reception, Package 1 might be the better fit.
> 
> What do you think? Are you having ceremony and cocktail hour at The Elliot too?"

## Alternative: More Direct Comparison

**If you want it more straightforward:**

> "Thanks for catching the date! I'll fix that to 10/10.
> 
> About the extra hour - I can remove it. So Package 2 without monogram would be $2,200 (Package 2 is $2,500, monogram a la carte is $300, so $2,200 total).
> 
> Here's the comparison:
> 
> **Package 1: $2,000** = Reception only (4 hours)
> **Package 2 (no monogram): $2,200** = Full day (ceremony + cocktail hour + reception, 6 hours)
> 
> For $200 more, Package 2 gives you ceremony audio and cocktail hour coverage. If you're having ceremony and cocktail hour at The Elliot, that's probably worth it. If your ceremony is elsewhere or you're just doing reception, Package 1 might work better.
> 
> What's your setup at The Elliot - are you doing ceremony, cocktail hour, and reception all there?"

## Why This Works

✅ **Acknowledges date fix** - Shows you're listening
✅ **Gives her the math** - Transparent pricing

✅ **Helps her decide** - Asks about her setup
✅ **Value-focused** - Shows what $200 more gets her
✅ **Conversational** - Matches your style

## Key Points

1. **Clear math** - Package 2 ($2,500) - Monogram ($300) = $2,200
2. **Direct comparison** - Package 1 ($2,000) vs Package 2 ($2,200)
3. **Value proposition** - What $200 more gets her
4. **Decision framework** - Based on her setup (ceremony location)
5. **No pressure** - Just information to help her decide

---

## Expected Outcomes

**Best case:**
- She realizes Package 2 is only $200 more
- Sees the value in ceremony + cocktail hour coverage
- Chooses Package 2 at $2,200
- No further removal requests

**Alternative:**
- She realizes her ceremony is elsewhere
- Chooses Package 1 at $2,000
- Still a sale, just different package

**Either way:**
- She makes an informed decision
- No negotiation spiral
- Relationship maintained
- Sale closed

---

## The Math Breakdown

**Package 2 without monogram:**
- Package 2: $2,500
- Monogram a la carte: $300
- New total: $2,200

**Package 1:**
- $2,000

**Difference:**
- $200 more for Package 2

**What $200 gets her:**
- Ceremony audio (+1 hour)
- Cocktail hour coverage (+1 hour)
- Full day seamless flow
- Total: 6 hours vs 4 hours

---

## Why Package 2 is Still Better (If She's Having Everything at The Elliot)

**If ceremony + cocktail hour + reception all at The Elliot:**
- Package 2 = Full day coverage, one DJ, seamless transitions
- Package 1 = Reception only, would need to add ceremony separately ($500+)
- Package 2 saves money and hassle

**If ceremony is elsewhere:**
- Package 1 might make more sense
- But she'd still need to add ceremony audio separately if she wants it

**The key question:** Where is her ceremony happening?

---

## Final Recommendation

**Use the first response** - it:
- Gives clear math
- Presents comparison
- Asks about her setup
- Lets her decide
- No pressure, just helpful information

The goal is to help her make the right decision for her situation, not to sell her on keeping the extra hour.
