## What This Means
Since all fields are empty but the questionnaire was started, it's possible:
1. She opened it but didn't fill anything out yet
2. She filled it out but the submission failed (which is why she said she tried 3 times)
3. The data was saved to localStorage but not to the database

## Next Steps
1. **Send her the questionnaire link** - She can access it and her progress should be saved
2. **Check if there's any partial data** - The improved error handling should now work
3. **If she submits again** - The new error messages will show exactly what's wrong if it fails
