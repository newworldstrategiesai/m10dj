## 🚨 Critical Issue: Location/Address

### Current Problem:

If you don't have a physical storefront:
1. Go to Google Business Profile
2. Settings → Business Information
3. Change to "Service Area Business"
4. Remove street address (if possible)
5. Set Service Areas:
   - Primary: Memphis, TN
   - Secondary: Germantown, TN; Collierville, TN; Bartlett, TN; Cordova, TN; East Memphis, TN

#### Option 2: Keep Address, Emphasize Service Area
If you must keep address:
1. Keep Eads address (if required)
2. Add "Service Areas" section prominently
3. List Memphis as primary service area
4. Update description to emphasize Memphis service
