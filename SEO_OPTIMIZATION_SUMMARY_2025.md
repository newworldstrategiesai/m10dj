## 🔬 RESEARCH-BACKED STRATEGY

### **We Researched Google's 2025 Ranking Factors:**

**Source:** Google Search Developer Documentation, WebFX, Search Engine Land

**Key Findings:**
1. **Structured Data** = 🔑 for AI Mode visibility
2. **E-E-A-T** (Experience, Expertise, Authority, Trust) = Critical for local businesses
3. **Conversational Keywords** = Target "Looking for..." and "best..." queries
4. **Direct Answers** = First 100 words should answer the query
5. **User Intent** = Title/meta must match search intent exactly

**All Implemented! ✅**

---

## 📊 AVOIDED KEYWORD CANNIBALIZATION

### **Your Site Has Multiple Wedding DJ Pages:**
- `/memphis-wedding-dj` (main pillar)
- `/wedding-dj-memphis-tn` (TN-specific)
- `/best-wedding-dj-memphis` (reviews focus)
- `/dj-near-me-memphis` (local search)

**✅ SOLUTION:** We kept all pages but gave each **distinct purpose and unique content**

**Strategy:**
- **Main pillar page** (`/memphis-wedding-dj`) = comprehensive wedding guide
- **TN-specific page** = state/regional focus
- **Best DJ page** = review/comparison focus
- **Near me page** = hyper-local neighborhood targeting

**Result:** No duplication, each page targets different user intent

## 🚨 CRITICAL: AVOID THESE MISTAKES

### **❌ DON'T DO:**

1. **❌ Don't create more wedding DJ pages**
   - You have 4 already - that's the limit
   - More = keyword cannibalization = everyone ranks lower

2. **❌ Don't change URLs**
   - Current URLs are indexed and have link equity
   - Changing = losing all that value

3. **❌ Don't remove schema markup**
   - 7 valid rich results = GOLD
   - Removing = instant visibility loss

4. **❌ Don't duplicate content between pages**
   - Each page needs unique value
   - Duplicates = Google penalizes all of them

5. **❌ Don't stuff keywords**
   - Natural language = better AI understanding
   - Keyword stuffing = penalty

### **✅ DO THIS INSTEAD:**

1. **✅ Monitor Google Search Console weekly**
   - Track position changes
   - Watch for rich result errors
   - Monitor CTR improvements

2. **✅ Add more FAQs (10-15 per page)**
   - Target exact queries from GSC data
   - Use natural language
   - Provide complete answers

3. **✅ Get more Google reviews**
   - Ask happy customers
   - Link review schema helps CTR
   - Target: 20+ reviews total

4. **✅ Create location-specific blog posts**
   - "Best Wedding Venues in Germantown TN"
   - "East Memphis Wedding DJ Guide"
   - Link back to location pages

5. **✅ Build local citations**
   - Memphis business directories
   - Wedding vendor listings
   - Consistent NAP (Name, Address, Phone)
