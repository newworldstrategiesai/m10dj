## 🚨 CRITICAL ISSUES

### 1. **Package 1 Has BETTER Savings Than Package 2**
- Package 1 saves $600 (23% off)
- Package 2 saves $350 (12% off)
- **Problem:** Why would anyone choose Package 2 when Package 1 has better value?

### 2. **Package 2 & 3 Have IDENTICAL Savings**
- Both save exactly $350
- **Problem:** No incentive to upgrade from Package 2 to Package 3
- The $500 upgrade only saves the same amount as Package 2

### 3. **Weak Value Proposition for "Most Popular" Package**
- Package 2 is marked "Most Popular" but has the WORST savings percentage
- Only 12% discount vs 23% for Package 1
- **Problem:** Clients will do the math and choose Package 1

### 4. **Package Progression Doesn't Make Sense**
- Package 1 → Package 2: Pay $500 more, get ceremony audio, LOSE additional speaker
- Package 2 → Package 3: Pay $500 more, get dancing on clouds
- **Problem:** Not a clear upgrade path - feels like side-grades

### 5. **No Clear Differentiation**
- What makes Package 2 "most popular"?
- Why would someone pay $500 more for Package 2 when Package 1 saves more?
- **Problem:** The "most popular" tag doesn't match the value proposition

## 💡 WHY WOULD A CLIENT CHOOSE EACH PACKAGE?

### Package 1 ($2,000)
**Why choose it:**
- ✅ Best value (23% savings)
- ✅ Includes additional speaker (good for cocktail hours)
- ✅ Perfect for reception-only events
- ✅ Lowest price point

**Why they might NOT:**
- ❌ No ceremony audio (need to add separately for $500)
- ❌ If they need ceremony, Package 2 might make more sense

### Package 2 ($2,500) - "Most Popular"
**Why choose it:**
- ✅ Includes ceremony audio (saves $500 vs adding separately)
- ✅ Most complete package for typical wedding
- ✅ Marked as "most popular" (social proof)

**Why they might NOT:**
- ❌ WORSE savings than Package 1 (12% vs 23%)
- ❌ No additional speaker (Package 1 has it)
- ❌ If they don't need ceremony, Package 1 is better value
- ❌ Math doesn't support "most popular" claim

### Package 3 ($3,000)
**Why choose it:**
- ✅ Includes dancing on clouds effect
- ✅ Most premium experience
- ✅ Everything in Package 2 plus special effects

**Why they might NOT:**
- ❌ Same savings as Package 2 (10% vs 12%)
- ❌ $500 for one effect seems expensive
- ❌ Could add dancing on clouds to Package 2 for same price

## 🔧 RECOMMENDED FIXES

### Option 1: Fix Package 2 Savings (RECOMMENDED)
**Make Package 2 save MORE than Package 1:**
- Keep Package 2 at $2,500
- Increase aLaCartePrice to $3,200 (add $350)
- **New Savings: $700 (22% discount)**
- This makes Package 2 the best value AND justifies "most popular"

### Option 2: Restructure Package Progression
**Create clear upgrade path:**
- Package 1: Reception only - $2,000 (saves $600)
- Package 2: Reception + Ceremony - $2,400 (saves $700) - NEW PRICE
- Package 3: Full Premium - $3,000 (saves $850) - NEW PRICE

### Option 3: Add Package 2 Exclusive Value
**Give Package 2 something unique:**
- Add monogram back (but make it clear it's a bonus)
- Or add "priority booking" or "extended consultation"
- Something that justifies the "most popular" tag

### Option 4: Adjust Package 1
**Make Package 1 less attractive:**
- Remove additional speaker from Package 1
- Or increase Package 1 price to $2,200
- This makes Package 2 more compelling

3. **Clear value progression:** Each package should save more in absolute dollars
4. **Justify "most popular" tag** with actual value, not just marketing
5. **Make upgrade path obvious:** Each package should clearly be "better" than the last
