# 🚨 URGENT: Fix Sitemap URLs - Critical SEO Issue

## ❌ Current Problem:
Your sitemap URLs are showing:
`https://m10dj-54vduodc2-bens-projects-c76699cb.vercel.app`

Instead of:
`https://m10djcompany.com`

## 🔧 IMMEDIATE FIX REQUIRED:

### Step 1: Set Production Environment Variable in Vercel

1. **Go to Vercel Dashboard**: https://vercel.com/dashboard
2. **Find your M10DJ project** and click on it
3. **Go to Settings** → **Environment Variables**
4. **Add new variable**:
   - **Name**: `NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL`
   - **Value**: `https://m10djcompany.com`
   - **Environment**: Production (uncheck Development & Preview)
5. **Click "Save"**

### Step 2: Redeploy Your Site
1. **Go to Deployments** tab in Vercel
2. **Click "Redeploy"** on the latest deployment
3. **OR** push a small change to trigger auto-deployment

### Step 3: Verify the Fix (After Deployment)
Check these URLs in your browser:
- **Sitemap**: https://m10djcompany.com/sitemap.xml
- **Robots**: https://m10djcompany.com/robots.txt

URLs should now show `https://m10djcompany.com` instead of Vercel preview URL.
