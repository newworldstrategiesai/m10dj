## ✅ What's ACCURATE & ACTIONABLE

### 1. Homepage Keyword Targeting Issue ⚠️ **CRITICAL FIX NEEDED**

**GPT Suggestion:**
- Primary: `memphis dj company`
- Title: "Memphis DJ Company | Weddings, Events & Parties"
- H1: "Professional DJ Services in Memphis, TN"

**Current Reality:**
- ❌ **Title:** "Memphis Wedding DJ | M10 DJ Company | 500+ Events"
- ❌ **Problem:** Homepage is targeting "Memphis Wedding DJ" which **cannibalizes** your `/memphis-wedding-dj` page
- ❌ **Keywords:** Homepage includes "wedding dj memphis" in keywords array

**Verdict:** ✅ **GPT IS CORRECT** - This is causing keyword cannibalization. Homepage should be general, not wedding-specific.

**Action Required:**
- Change homepage title to: "Memphis DJ Company | Professional DJ Services | M10 DJ Company"
- Remove "wedding dj memphis" from homepage keywords
- Make homepage general service overview
- Link to wedding page, don't compete with it

---

### 2. Wedding DJ Page - URL Mismatch

**GPT Suggestion:**
- URL: `/wedding-dj-memphis`
- Primary: `wedding dj memphis`
- Title: "Wedding DJ Memphis TN | M10 DJ Company"

**Current Reality:**
- ✅ **URL:** `/memphis-wedding-dj` (different word order)
- ✅ **Title:** "Memphis Wedding DJ | M10 DJ Company | 500+ Weddings"
- ✅ **H1:** "Memphis Wedding DJ - Professional Wedding Entertainment"
- ✅ **Keywords:** Well-optimized for wedding DJ keywords

**Verdict:** ⚠️ **PARTIALLY CORRECT** - Page exists and is optimized, but URL doesn't match exact search. Consider:
- Option A: Create `/wedding-dj-memphis` redirect → `/memphis-wedding-dj` (with canonical)
- Option B: Keep current URL (it's fine, just different word order)
- Option C: Create both URLs with proper canonicalization

**Action:** Current page is fine, but exact URL match (`/wedding-dj-memphis`) could help rankings slightly.

---

### 3. Wedding DJ Packages Page - MISSING

**GPT Suggestion:**
- URL: `/wedding-dj-packages-memphis`
- Primary: `wedding dj packages memphis`

**Current Reality:**
- ❌ **Missing:** No dedicated packages page
- ⚠️ **Partial:** Packages mentioned on `/memphis-wedding-dj` but not dedicated page

**Verdict:** ✅ **GPT IS CORRECT** - This page should exist. High-intent search, converts well.

**Action Required:** Create this page - it's a high-priority addition.

---

### 4. Corporate DJ - Keyword Mismatch

**GPT Suggestion:**
- URL: `/corporate-dj-memphis`
- Primary: `corporate dj memphis`
- Title: "Corporate DJ Memphis | Professional Event DJs"

**Current Reality:**
- ✅ **URL:** `/corporate-events` (exists)
- ⚠️ **Title:** "Corporate Event DJ Memphis | Business Entertainment"
- ⚠️ **Keywords:** "Memphis corporate DJ" (not exact match)

**Verdict:** ⚠️ **PARTIALLY CORRECT** - Page exists but:
- URL doesn't match exact keyword
- Title is close but not exact
- Could optimize for exact match

**Action Options:**
- Option A: Update existing page title to include "Corporate DJ Memphis" prominently
- Option B: Create `/corporate-dj-memphis` redirect → `/corporate-events`
- Option C: Keep as-is (it's functional, just not exact match)

---

### 5. Event DJ - Keyword Mismatch

**GPT Suggestion:**
- URL: `/event-dj-memphis`
- Primary: `event dj memphis`
- Title: "Event DJ Memphis | Parties & Private Events"

**Current Reality:**
- ✅ **URL:** `/memphis-event-dj-services` (exists)
- ⚠️ **Title:** Likely "Memphis Event DJ Services" (different phrasing)

**Verdict:** ⚠️ **PARTIALLY CORRECT** - Page exists but URL/keyword don't match exactly.

**Action:** Similar to corporate - optimize existing or create redirect.

---

### 6. School Dance DJ - EXISTS ✅

**GPT Suggestion:**
- URL: `/school-dance-dj-memphis`
- Primary: `school dance dj memphis`

**Current Reality:**
- ✅ **URL:** `/school-dances` (exists)
- ✅ **Title:** "School Dance DJ Services Memphis | M10 DJ Company | Prom, Homecoming & School Events"
- ✅ **Content:** Covers prom, homecoming, school dances

**Verdict:** ✅ **EXISTS** - Just different URL. Current page is well-optimized.

**Action:** Consider adding "dj" to URL (`/school-dance-dj-memphis`) OR keep as-is (it's fine).

---

### 7. Upsell Pages - MISSING (High ROI Opportunity) ✅

**GPT Suggestions:**
- `/dj-uplighting-memphis` ❌ Missing
- `/photo-booth-rental-memphis` ❌ Missing
- `/cold-sparks-memphis` ❌ Missing

**Verdict:** ✅ **GPT IS CORRECT** - These are high-margin upsells that deserve dedicated pages.

**Action Required:** Create these pages - highest ROI opportunity.

---

### 8. Service Area Page - OPTIONAL

**GPT Suggestion:**
- URL: `/memphis-dj-service-areas`
- Lists suburbs with internal links

**Current Reality:**
- ✅ **Location Pages Exist:** `/dj-germantown-tn`, `/dj-collierville-tn`, `/dj-east-memphis-tn`
- ❌ **Hub Page Missing:** No central service area page

**Verdict:** ⚠️ **OPTIONAL** - You have location pages, but a hub page could help. Lower priority.

## 🚨 Keyword Cannibalization Issues Found

### Issue 1: Homepage Competing with Wedding Page
- **Homepage** targets "Memphis Wedding DJ" 
- **Wedding Page** targets "Memphis Wedding DJ"
- **Problem:** Both pages compete for same keywords
- **Fix:** Make homepage general, wedding page specific

### Issue 2: Multiple Pages Targeting Similar Keywords
- `/memphis-wedding-dj` - "Memphis Wedding DJ"
- `/wedding-dj-memphis-tn` - "Wedding DJ Memphis TN"
- `/best-wedding-dj-memphis` - "Best Wedding DJ Memphis"
- **Status:** These are differentiated enough (different intent), but monitor for conflicts

---

## 📊 Recommended Action Plan

### Priority 1: Fix Homepage (CRITICAL - Prevents Cannibalization)
1. **Update Homepage Title:**
   - From: "Memphis Wedding DJ | M10 DJ Company | 500+ Events"
   - To: "Memphis DJ Company | Professional DJ Services | M10 DJ Company"

2. **Update Homepage H1:**
   - To: "Professional DJ Services in Memphis, TN"

3. **Remove Wedding-Specific Keywords:**
   - Remove "wedding dj memphis" from homepage keywords
   - Keep general: "Memphis DJ", "DJ Memphis", "Professional DJ Memphis"

4. **Add Internal Links:**
   - Link prominently to `/memphis-wedding-dj` page
   - Link to other service pages

**Impact:** Prevents keyword cannibalization, improves wedding page rankings

---

### Priority 2: Create Missing High-Value Pages

1. **`/wedding-dj-packages-memphis`** (High Priority)
   - High-intent search
   - Converts well
   - Easy to create

2. **`/dj-uplighting-memphis`** (High ROI)
   - High-margin upsell
   - Easy to rank
   - Converts well

   - Different intent
   - Deserves own page

4. **`/cold-sparks-memphis`** (High ROI)
   - Premium upsell
   - Specific search intent

---

### Priority 3: Optimize Existing Pages (Optional)

1. **Corporate Events Page:**
   - Add "Corporate DJ Memphis" to title more prominently
   - Consider creating `/corporate-dj-memphis` redirect

2. **Event DJ Page:**
   - Consider creating `/event-dj-memphis` redirect
   - OR update title to include exact keyword

3. **School Dances Page:**
   - Consider URL change to `/school-dance-dj-memphis`
   - OR keep as-is (it's fine)

---

## ✅ What's Already Good (Don't Change)

1. ✅ `/memphis-wedding-dj` - Well-optimized, just different URL order
2. ✅ `/wedding-dj-memphis-tn` - Good differentiation (TN-focused)
3. ✅ `/best-wedding-dj-memphis` - Good differentiation (review-focused)
4. ✅ `/school-dances` - Well-optimized
5. ✅ Location pages (Germantown, Collierville, East Memphis)
6. ✅ Pricing content (multiple pages)

---

## 🎯 Internal Linking Strategy (GPT's Recommendation is Good)

**GPT's Rule:** "Every page should link up to its main service"

**Current Status:**
- ✅ Homepage links to wedding page (good)
- ⚠️ Some pages could link more prominently to main service pages

**Action:**
- Ensure all service pages link back to main wedding page
- Ensure all location pages link to wedding page
- Create clear hierarchy: Homepage → Service Pages → Location Pages
