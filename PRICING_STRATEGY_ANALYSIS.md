# Pricing Strategy Analysis & Recommendations

## Current Issues Identified

### 🔴 Critical Issues

1. **Price Inconsistencies Between Package Breakdowns and Addon Prices**
   - **Monogram Projection**: 
     - Package breakdown shows: $200
     - Addon price: $350
     - **Problem**: Customers see it cheaper in packages, then more expensive as addon → confusion
   
   - **Dancing on the Clouds**:
     - Package 3 breakdown shows: $450
     - Addon price: $500
     - **Problem**: Same confusion - why is it cheaper in the package?
   
   - **Dance Floor Lighting**:
     - Package 1 breakdown: $400
     - Package 2 breakdown: $350
     - **Problem**: Same item priced differently in different packages

2. **Missing Addons**
   - **Ceremony Audio** ($500) - Available in Package 2 & 3, but NOT as standalone addon
     - Customer can't add ceremony to Package 1
     - Forces upgrade to Package 2 even if they only want ceremony
   
   - **Dance Floor Lighting** - Available in all packages but NOT as standalone addon
     - Customer can't add it to a la carte selection
     - Inconsistent pricing ($350-$400) across packages

3. **Math Doesn't Add Up**
   - Package 2 breakdown total: $3,000 (matches aLaCartePrice ✓)
   - Package 3 breakdown total: $3,500 (but aLaCartePrice shows $3,500, actual breakdown is $3,500)
   - However, if customer adds "Dancing on the Clouds" to Package 2, they pay $500, but Package 3 shows it at $450 in breakdown

## Recommended Strategy

### Core Principle: **Consistency is Key**
- **Same item = Same price everywhere**
- Package breakdown prices MUST match addon prices

- Uplighting (16 fixtures): $350
- Monogram Projection: $350
- Dancing on the Clouds: $500

```

### Add Missing Addons

Add these to the wedding addons list:
1. **Ceremony Audio** - $500
   - Description: "Additional hour of DJ services + ceremony music programming. Perfect for couples who want professional audio for their ceremony."
   
2. **Dance Floor Lighting** - $400
   - Description: "Multi-color LED fixtures for lighting the dance floor, audience, and/or performer. Creates an energetic atmosphere."

## Benefits of This Approach

1. **Trust**: Customers see consistent pricing everywhere
2. **Clarity**: No confusion about why items cost different amounts
3. **Flexibility**: Customers can build custom packages with all items available
