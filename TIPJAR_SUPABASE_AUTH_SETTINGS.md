# 🔐 TipJar Supabase Auth Settings Checklist

## Critical Settings for Login to Work

### 1. **Redirect URLs** (MOST IMPORTANT)

Go to: **Supabase Dashboard** → **Authentication** → **URL Configuration**

Add these redirect URLs to the **"Redirect URLs"** list:

**Production:**
```
https://tipjar.live/auth/callback
https://tipjar.live/auth/reset_password
https://www.tipjar.live/auth/callback
https://www.tipjar.live/auth/reset_password
```

**Local Development:**
```
http://localhost:3000/auth/callback
http://localhost:3000/auth/reset_password
http://localhost:3006/auth/callback
http://localhost:3006/auth/reset_password
http://127.0.0.1:3000/auth/callback
http://127.0.0.1:3006/auth/callback
```

**For Deploy Previews (if using Vercel):**
```
https://*-your-username.vercel.app/auth/callback
https://*-your-username.vercel.app/auth/reset_password
```

**Click "Save" after adding all URLs.**

---

### 2. **Site URL**

Go to: **Supabase Dashboard** → **Authentication** → **URL Configuration**

Set **"Site URL"** to:
```
https://tipjar.live
```

This is the base URL Supabase uses for email links and redirects.

---

### 3. **Email Confirmation Settings**

Go to: **Supabase Dashboard** → **Authentication** → **Settings**

Check the **"Enable email confirmations"** setting:

**Option A: Disable Email Confirmation (Easier for Testing)**
- ✅ Uncheck "Enable email confirmations"
- Users can sign in immediately after signup
- **Good for:** Testing, development, quick onboarding

**Option B: Keep Email Confirmation Enabled (Recommended for Production)**
- ✅ Keep "Enable email confirmations" checked
- Users must click email link before they can sign in
- **Good for:** Production, security, preventing fake accounts

**If email confirmation is enabled:**
- User must check their email and click the confirmation link
- The link will redirect to `/auth/callback` which should be in your redirect URLs (see #1)
- After confirmation, they'll be redirected to the dashboard

---

### 4. **Password Auth Provider**

Go to: **Supabase Dashboard** → **Authentication** → **Providers**

Make sure **"Email"** provider is enabled:
- ✅ **Enable Email provider** should be ON
- ✅ **Confirm email** - See setting #3 above
- ✅ **Secure email change** - Can be enabled for extra security

---

### 5. **Check User Account Status**

If you're testing with `memphismillennial@gmail.com`:

1. Go to: **Supabase Dashboard** → **Authentication** → **Users**
2. Search for the email address
3. Check:
   - ✅ **Email confirmed?** - If not, user needs to click email confirmation link
   - ✅ **User is active?** - Should be enabled
   - ✅ **Last sign in** - Check if there are any errors

**If email is not confirmed:**
- Option 1: Disable email confirmation (see #3)
- Option 2: Resend confirmation email from Supabase dashboard
- Option 3: Manually confirm the user in Supabase dashboard

---

### 6. **Email Templates (Optional but Recommended)**

Go to: **Supabase Dashboard** → **Authentication** → **Email Templates**

Update subject lines to reduce spam:

**Confirm Signup:**
- Subject: `Welcome to TipJar - Confirm Your Account`

**Reset Password:**
- Subject: `TipJar Password Reset Request`

**Magic Link:**
- Subject: `Sign in to TipJar`

---

2. ✅ **Site URL set** to `https://tipjar.live`
3. ✅ **Email provider enabled**
