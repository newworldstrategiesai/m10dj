1. Costa Rica - Great beaches and rainforests
2. Japan - Amazing food and culture
3. Italy - Beautiful cities and countryside

Let me know your thoughts. We should book soon to get the best prices.

Would you like to grab dinner this weekend? There's a new Italian restaurant downtown that I've been wanting to try.

They have great reviews, and I heard their pasta is amazing. Let me know if you're free either Saturday or Sunday evening.

Hope you can make it!
