## The Thread Context
- Client: Marlee
- Event: Wedding on 10/10/26 at The Elliot (formerly Pin Oak)

---

## Recommended Response

**Message to send:**

> "Thanks for catching that date! I'll get that fixed to 10/10 right away.
> 
> About the extra hour - I should mention, we're actually in the process of updating our website and packages. The monogram projection wasn't originally supposed to be part of Package 2 - it was temporarily added while we updated our pricing. So removing it was actually correcting the package structure. The extra hour is what should have been there all along and is a core part of Package 2.
> 
> The extra hour is really valuable - it ensures smooth transitions between your ceremony, cocktail hour, and reception. Most couples find they need that buffer time for photos, guest arrival, or unexpected delays. Without it, you risk rushing between events or potentially paying overtime fees if things run long.
> 
> Package 2 at $2,250 (without the monogram) is the correct package structure. The extra hour is included at the discounted bundle rate and is really worth keeping for peace of mind on your wedding day. Does that work for you?"

## Alternative: Softer Version

**If you want to be even more conversational:**

> "Thanks for catching the date! I'll fix that to 10/10.
> 
> About the extra hour - I should explain, we're updating our website and packages right now. The monogram wasn't actually supposed to be in Package 2 originally - it was temporarily added while we updated things. So removing it was fixing the package structure. The extra hour is what should be there and is a core part of Package 2.
> 
> It's really valuable though - it gives you that buffer time between ceremony, cocktail hour, and reception. Most couples find they need it for photos running long, guests arriving late, or just having some breathing room. Without it, you risk rushing or potentially paying overtime if things run over.
> 
> Package 2 at $2,250 (without monogram) is the correct structure. The extra hour is included at the bundle discount and is definitely worth keeping. Sound good?"

## Why This Works

✅ **Acknowledges date correction** - Shows you're listening
✅ **Frames monogram removal as correction** - Not customization
✅ **Explains extra hour is correct item** - Sets boundary
✅ **Friendly and conversational** - Matches your style
✅ **Value-focused** - Explains why it's worth keeping
✅ **Assumes the sale** - "Does that work for you?" / "Sound good?"

---

## Key Points

1. **Date fix** - Quick acknowledgment
2. **Context** - Website/package update explanation
3. **Framing** - Monogram = error correction, extra hour = correct item
4. **Value** - Why extra hour matters
5. **Boundary** - Extra hour stays (but friendly)
6. **Close** - Assumes the sale

## Tone Check

**Your style:**
- Casual and friendly
- Empathetic ("I know how it goes")
- Direct but warm
- Uses emojis occasionally
- Conversational, not formal

**This response:**
- ✅ Matches your casual tone
- ✅ Friendly and warm
- ✅ Direct but not harsh
- ✅ Professional but conversational
- ✅ Value-focused, not salesy

## If She Pushes Back

**If she says:** "But can't you just remove it?"

**Response:**
> "I totally get it - trying to keep costs down makes sense. The thing is, the extra hour is actually a core part of Package 2 and is included at the discounted bundle rate. If we remove core items, we'd have to price it closer to a la carte rates, which would actually cost more.
> 
> Package 2 at $2,250 (without monogram) is still a great value - you're saving $1,150 compared to a la carte. The extra hour really is worth it for peace of mind on your wedding day. Does that work?"

**Key:**
- Acknowledge her concern
- Explain the policy (bundle discount)
- Reinforce value
- Assume the sale

---

## Final Recommendation

**Use the first response** - it's:
- Friendly and matches your style
- Clear about the boundary
- Explains the context
- Value-focused
- Assumes the sale

The key is framing it as "correcting the package structure" not "I can remove one thing but not another" - which makes it feel consistent and professional.
