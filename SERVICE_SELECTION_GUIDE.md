# Service Selection System - Complete Guide

## 🎯 What This Does

Creates **unique, secure links** for each lead to:
- Select their DJ package (Basic, Premium, Platinum)
- Choose event timeline (ceremony, cocktail hour, reception)
- Specify music preferences
- Share special requests
- Indicate budget range

**Result:** Qualified leads with detailed preferences ready for instant quoting!

---

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Step 1: Run Migration (2 min)
```bash
cd /Users/benmurray/m10dj
supabase db push
```

This creates:
- `service_selection_tokens` - Secure unique tokens
- `service_selections` - Submitted choices
- Contact tracking fields

### Step 2: Send to New Lead (30 seconds)
```javascript
// When new lead comes in
await fetch('/api/automation/send-service-selection', {
  method: 'POST',
  body: JSON.stringify({ contactId: 'uuid-here' })
});

// Lead receives beautiful email with unique link!
```

### Step 3: Lead Fills Out Form (3 minutes)
Lead clicks link → Sees personalized page → Selects services → Submits

### Step 4: You Get Notification (Instant)
- Email notification: "Lead completed service selection!"
- View their choices in admin panel
- Contact marked as "Hot" lead
- Ready to send quote

---

## 📧 Automatic Integration with Email System

### Option A: Manually Send Link
```javascript
// From admin panel or API
await fetch('/api/automation/send-service-selection', {
  method: 'POST',
  body: JSON.stringify({ contactId: contact.id })
});
```

### Option B: Auto-Send with Lead Follow-up
Update your `lead_follow_up_1` template to include service selection:

```sql
UPDATE automation_templates 
SET body_template = '<p>... your existing template ...</p>

<div style="text-align: center; margin: 30px 0;">
  <a href="{{selection_link}}" style="background-color: #667eea; color: white; padding: 15px 30px; text-decoration: none; border-radius: 8px; font-weight: bold;">
    ✨ Select Your Services
  </a>
</div>

<p>Takes just 3 minutes and helps us provide an accurate quote!</p>'
WHERE template_name = 'lead_follow_up_1';
```

Then modify `/api/automation/trigger-lead.js` to generate link first.

## 📈 Tracking & Analytics

### Monitor Completion Rate

```sql
SELECT 
  COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE service_selection_sent = true) as sent,
  COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE service_selection_completed = true) as completed,
  ROUND(
    COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE service_selection_completed = true)::numeric / 
    NULLIF(COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE service_selection_sent = true), 0) * 100,
    2
  ) as completion_rate_percent
FROM contacts;
```

### Popular Package Choices

```sql
SELECT 
  package_selected,
  COUNT(*) as count,
  ROUND(AVG(guest_count)) as avg_guests,
  AVG(estimated_price) as avg_price
FROM service_selections
GROUP BY package_selected
ORDER BY count DESC;
```

### Recent Submissions

```sql
SELECT 
  c.first_name,
  c.last_name,
  c.email_address,
  s.package_selected,
  s.event_date,
  s.submitted_at,
  s.status
FROM service_selections s
JOIN contacts c ON c.id = s.contact_id
ORDER BY s.submitted_at DESC
LIMIT 20;
```

### Revenue Pipeline

```sql
SELECT 
  status,
  COUNT(*) as count,
  SUM(estimated_price) as total_value
FROM service_selections
GROUP BY status
ORDER BY 
  CASE status
    WHEN 'submitted' THEN 1
    WHEN 'reviewed' THEN 2
    WHEN 'quoted' THEN 3
    WHEN 'booked' THEN 4
  END;
```

## 🔥 Pro Tips

### 1. Send Early
Send service selection link in **first follow-up** (not 3rd or 4th). Higher completion rate when interest is fresh!

### 2. Mobile Optimize
60% of leads will view on mobile. Page is already mobile-responsive! ✅

### 3. Follow Up Incomplete
```sql
-- Find leads who received link but didn't complete
SELECT 
  c.id,
  c.first_name,
  c.email_address,
  c.service_selection_sent_at,
  EXTRACT(DAY FROM NOW() - c.service_selection_sent_at) as days_ago
FROM contacts c
WHERE c.service_selection_sent = true
AND c.service_selection_completed = false
AND c.service_selection_sent_at > NOW() - INTERVAL '30 days';
```

Send reminder: "Haven't had a chance to select your services? Here's your link..."

### 4. Pre-Fill What You Know
System automatically pre-fills:
- Event type (if known from initial inquiry)
- Event date
- Venue name
- Guest count
- Budget range

Less work for lead = higher completion!

### 5. Use for Re-engagement
Have cold leads from months ago? Send service selection link to re-engage:

"Hi [Name], still planning your [event]? I'd love to help! Select your services here: [link]"

### 6. Track in CRM
Service selections = qualified leads. Update your lead scoring:
- Completed service selection: +50 points
- Selected Premium/Platinum: +25 points
- Budget >$2k: +25 points

---

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

### "Link doesn't work"
- Check token hasn't expired (30 days default)
- Verify token exists in database
- Check URL is complete (no truncation)

### "Already submitted" but they didn't
```sql
-- Reset token
UPDATE service_selection_tokens 
SET is_used = false, used_at = null
WHERE token = 'abc123XYZ';
```

### "Want to generate new link"
```javascript
// Just call API again - creates new token
await fetch('/api/service-selection/generate-link', {
  method: 'POST',
  body: JSON.stringify({ contactId: contact.id })
});
```

### "Need to edit submission"
Currently one-time use. Options:
1. Have them email changes
2. Reset token (see above) and resend
3. Update directly in database
